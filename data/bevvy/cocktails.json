    "description": "The Garibaldi is an exceedingly simple two-ingredient cocktail, but one that tastes more intricate than it is. Traditionally composed of equal parts Campari and Orange juice, more recent iterations of the Garibaldi have upped the orange juice for a longer, more refreshing drink.Here, we're doing just that, with 1.5 ounces of Campari and 4 ounces of orange juice. That said, feel free to experiment to suit your own tastes. Whatever you do, be sure to use fresh-squeezed orange juice in your Garibaldi, which is needed to add that rich, orange-y sweetness to the bitter Campari.If you've got a juicer or blender, or a milk frother, or don't mind shaking up some OJ for awhile, you can attempt the \"fluffy\" orange juice that was popularized by Naren Young's NYC bar, Dante. For their Garibaldi, the juice is blended on a high speed, which aerates it and leaves it with a thick and fluffy texture. It's delightful.",

As with the B-52, the Flaming B-52 recipe consists of a coffee liqueur (commonly Kahlúa Coffee Liqueur), an Irish cream (commonly Baileys Irish Cream), and an orange liqueur (commonly Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge)—layered—in that order, but an extra layer of overproof rum (commonly Bacardi 151) is added on top to help facilitate the flame being lit. Once lit, the Flaming B-52 should be drank quickly by placing a heat-resistant straw to the bottom of the shot glass before the glass heats up too much. The Flaming B-52 shooter became popular due to the crowd-pleasing spectacle it creates with the flame and being lit. These days, it has thankfully waned in popularity, as it is more of a gimmick than a great drink.",

    "description": "The Vegas Bomb cocktail is a potent shot that's a popular order at bars. It's not the craftiest or most nuanced beverage—but you can't deny that it's fun. The Vegas Bomb recipe consists of three liquors—Crown Royal Canadian whisky, peach schnapps, and Malibu rum (or other coconut rum)—plus Red Bull energy drink. That's what you'll find being served in the vast majority of cases, however, occasionally recipes throw in a splash of cranberry juice or some butterscotch schnapps, or they employ other brands of energy drinks besides Red Bull.How to Drink a Vegas BombDrinking a Vegas Bomb involves dropping a shot glass into a larger glass (similar to other \"bomb drinks,\" including the Jäger Bomb and Sake Bomb) and chugging the contents in one go. In this case, the three liquors are combined together in the shot glass, then dropped into a glass of Red Bull.The Vegas Bomb drink isn't what you would call a nuanced cocktail, but if a party drink is what you're looking for, the Vegas Bomb shot is a fun and popular one—particularly among college students, bachelorette parties, and bachelor parties—who desire a dose of caffeine with their alcohol. And most party-centric bars, especially those that serve a college crowd, will have the ingredients on hand to make one.Alternatively, if you don't want to go the two-glass-chug route, you can simply shake all four ingredients together with ice in a cocktail shaker, strain the contents into a glass and drink at your leisure. It doesn't have quite the communal, glass-slamming effect as your typical Vegas Bomb experience, but it tastes the same and still gets the job done.Vegas Bomb OriginsSo, where does the name \"Vegas Bomb\" come from? There are some who believe the Crown Royal symbolizes a Royal Flush—the highest ranking poker hand—which makes the name fitting in true Las Vegas fashion. There is also a Royal Flush Shot, a mixture of Crown, cranberry, peach schnapps, and raspberry liqueur, so the Vegas Bomb shot recipe is an easy departure from that, losing the raspberry while adding the Red Bull and glass-within-a-glass drinking method.Those are both very plausible reasons for the name. But one thing we can absolutely confirm we've heard is this: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. But what happens after Vegas Bombs, well, that's less certain.",

    "description": "The classic Margarita is a simple, citrusy cocktail, and for more than 40 years it’s been the unmistakable face of summertime and south-of-the-border beach hangouts (and, really, of tequila drinks in general). Unfortunately, thanks to the popularity of syrupy pre-made mix, most people’s homemade Margaritas leave a bit to be desired. But with a little elbow grease and an extra minute or two of prep time, it’s easy to whip up a Margarita that’s fresh, well-balanced, and delicious—and should prove a spectacular companion to some chips and salsa.What's in a Margarita?Over the years, we've seen the rise of blender Margaritas, Frozen Margaritas, and Skinny Margaritas, but for today's purposes we'll be sticking to the original (and please, no Margarita mix). This classic Margarita recipe calls for an ounce of fresh lime juice (if you don't feel like measuring, it's roughly the juice of one medium lime), a triple sec or orange liqueur such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier, and, of course, tequila. The drink is often garnished by a lime wedge or a salted rim, based on the preferences of those ordering it. The history of the Margarita Like many classic cocktails, the origins of the Margarita are shrouded in mystery. What's clear is that it belongs the the \"daisy\" category of cocktails, which are broadly defined as drinks made with a base spirit, liqueur, and citrus. Historically, the Sidecar serves as a popular example of the daisy template, and it's thought that this was adapted for the tastes of drinkers in Mexico with tequila in place of brandy.As per who mixed the first margarita and where, there are many competing versions that have either been debunked or cannot be verified. But it is known that the first printed recipe for a Margarita appeared in a 1953 issue of Esquire, which entailed tequila, triple sec and either lime or lemon juice. How to make a MargaritaMaking a Margarita is straightforward. After gathering your ingredients, you will add them to a a cocktail shaker and shake until chilled. Afterwards, pour the contents into a a Margarita glass and enjoy (ideally, some tacos will be nearby).Popular tequilas for a MargaritaBlanco tequila is the standard choice, as it's straightforward and mixes well, but you're welcome to use a reposado tequila if you want something a little different. That said, the oaky subtleties of a reposado or añejo tequila tend to be lost in a Margarita cocktail, so we don't recommend using anything too aged—or too expensive.",

It is a delicious, spirit-forward cocktail that is a nice balance of sweet, tart, and strong.The phrase \"bee's knees\" was often used to call something \"the best,\" and was a popular saying during the Roaring Twenties, a decade of opulence, decadence, and despite Prohibition, craft cocktails.Back then, ingredients like honey, citrus, and other sweeteners or fruits were often mixed with the era's harsh spirits to \"soften\" them up, mask the bad flavors, and make the drinks more palatable. In the case of the Bee's Knees cocktail, the strong flavor of the lemon with the sweetness of the honey helped turn the notorious bathtub gin of the time into a tasty and popular tipple.",

    "description": "The Singapore Sling was invented at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon, sometime in the 1900s or early 1910s. The recipe for the Singapore Sling changed drastically over time, due to being codified on handwritten notes, getting lost in translation as it traveled the globe, and the gradual decline in availability of some of its ingredients, like Cherry Heering and Bénédictine. Today, though, it's possible to make a Singapore Sling that's pretty close to the original, which is the recipe provided below. It doesn't traditionally have a garnish of any kind, but you can use a lime twist (added later at the Raffles Hotel) or a maraschino cherry if you're so inclined.",

It was invented sometime between 1915 and 1922 by Victor Morris, an American expat bartender in Lima, Peru, and gradually became an international hit. It's a variation on the Whiskey Sour (and other sour cocktails), though it uses lime juice where that recipe typically uses lemon. The Peruvian Pisco Sour uses egg whites and bitters, but the Chilean recipe does not. It's the national drink of both countries, though, and there's a pretty fierce rivalry over who gets credit for the original.",

This will keep it on the surface of the cocktail, and give it that classic Cadillac Margarita taste on the first sip.",

The Black Tooth Grin, a simple combination of Crown Royal, Seagram's 7, and Coca-Cola, made that whiskey go down easier. The name comes from a lyric in a Megadeth song called \"Sweating Bullets.\"The cocktail (if you can call it that) is made by combining equal parts Crown and Seagram's 7 in a glass with ice, and then adding ice a splash of Coke—just enough to darken the color and provide some sweetness to the whiskey. Knock it back in one go, if you want to stay true to tradition, or just sip it slowly because you're an adult and can do whatever you want.",

    "description": "The Piña Colada is one of the most popular tropical rum cocktails, and sadly one that has been bastardized by poolside bars the world over. This is a classic Piña Colada recipe that doesn't use any kind of pre-made mix, instead opting for coconut cream and fresh pineapple juice. Be sure to use a proper coconut cream, as the alternative, coconut milk, is usually too thin. However, it will do in a pinch, and you can add a bit of condensed milk if you want to thicken it up a bit.While most recipes call for white rum, a gold or dark rum can make things a little more interesting—just don't bother using anything expensive, as its subtleties will be lost in the rest of the ingredients. This Piña Colada is blended, but you can also make a shaken version. Simply add all the ingredients to a cocktail shaker with ice, shake until chilled, and strain into a Hurricane glass with fresh ice.",

The drink was made famous by its (potentially apocryphal) role in the Second Battle of El Alamein in World War Two.\nThe story goes that, the morning of the battle, the Hussar soldiers in Cairo were caught off guard by Rommel's forces after a night of particularly heavy drinking. The army sent a cable to Scialom requesting an urgent delivery of several gallons of his famous hangover cure, the Suffering Bastard. He delivered, the soldiers recovered, and the Germans were kept at bay.",

So while the change is subtle, it's noticeable.The Gibson's origin is unclear, but the oldest published recipe for the cocktail is believed to appear in William Boothby's 1908 book, The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them.",

It's mostly just a Daiquiri variation, but it also resembles the classic Daisy (the drink that birthed the Margarita) with its use of curaçao. According to Jeff \"Beachbum\" Berry, an even better rendition can be made with two ounces of rum, one ounce of curaçao, and one ounce of lime (pictured).",

    "description": "The Planter's Punch recipe, like so many tiki drinks, depends a lot on the tastes of the bartender making it. The original can be traced back to the early 1900s (sometimes under the name Jamaican Rum Punch or Creole Punch), and has at times been as simple as rum, lime, sugar, and water, or as complicated as a mixture of dozens of tropical fruit juices—for better or worse.To differentiate it from other classic rum cocktails like the Daiquiri, though, we've gone with a more modern interpretation that falls somewhere in between the two extremes. This Planter's Punch recipe uses dark rum, pineapple, lime, and orange juices, and a splash of grenadine to make for a fantastic tropical drink. Be sure to use fresh juices if possible (at least for the lime and orange, since pineapple can be a pain unless you have a juicer), and a good, classic grenadine like Liber & Co. or Small Hand Foods, not the overly-syrupy Rose's.Planter's Punch, as its name implies, can also easily be made as a punch for a large group by multiplying this recipe by the number of servings you need.",

It's a fairly simple cocktail, sort of a South American analog of the Mint Julep. All that's involved is muddled lime, sugar, and cachaça, so it's a pretty powerful, spirit-forward drink even with the refreshing dose of citrusy sweetness. If you want to take the edge off (or if you're simply using a cheap cachaça), we recommend using crushed ice, as it melts faster.",

To garnish the Scorpion cocktail, you can use a slice or two of any citrus you'd like (orange or lemon are typical), a couple of good maraschino cherries, and a sprig of mint (clapped between your hands to release the essential oils) to really round out the aromas.This Scorpion recipe makes one serving, but it can easily be multiplied to serve in the classic Scorpion Bowl, which is a favorite at tiki bars around the world. The Scorpion Bowl typically has a smaller bowl in the center, into which you can pour some overproof rum and light it on fire for an extra-exotic presentation.",

    "description": "The Tequila Sunrise is a 1970s-era cocktail comprised of tequila, grenadine, and orange juice. When served, the grenadine sinks to the bottom, creating a layered effect, which gives the drink its name.The Tequila Sunrise's origin story is attributed to Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice, bartenders at the Trident in Sausalito, CA. The drink gained notoriety in 1972, when Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones visited the bar and drank the cocktail. They enjoyed it so much, that they kept on drinking them, and their 1972 tour was affectionately dubbed the \"Cocaine and Tequila Sunrise Tour.\" This helped to catapult the drink's status, with it soon becoming part of the marketing effort for Jose Cuervo, and even resulting in the Tequila Sunrise song on the Eagles' Desperado album, which debuted the following year.For decades, the Tequila Sunrise has been concocted with cheap orange juice and sickly sweet grenadine, and it eventually began to fall out of favor, as drinkers turned toward craft cocktails. But today, it can still be found on menus across the world. Fortunately, some enterprising bartenders have begun to make the drink with 100% agave tequila, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and real pomegranate grenadine. The difference is notable, and bridges the gap between the generally dark days of 1970s cocktailing and that of our modern era.So if you're making a Tequila Sunrise at home—which is a very easy thing to do—we suggest you follow suit. Because a well-made Tequila Sunrise featuring fresh ingredients is a respectable and Vitamin C-spiked addition to your next breakfast.",

    "description": "The Corpse Reviver #2 is a fun name for a serious cocktail. It first appeared in Harry Craddock's \"Savoy Cocktail Book\" and features five ingredients: gin, Cointreau, Lillet Blanc, fresh lemon juice and absinthe. The first four ingredients are shaken with ice, while the absinthe is used to rinse the serving glass and is discarded before you strain the cocktail, so just a hint of absinthe is present in the finished drink.The recipe calls for a couple specifics here: namely Lillet Blanc and Cointreau. You can substitute Cocchi Americano for the Lillet to good effect, but Cointreau tends to fare better than other orange liqueurs, so we suggest sticking with it. If you can't find absinthe, a pastis (an anise-flavored spirit) like Herbsaint works nicely.Why's It Called a Corpse Reviver?The Corpse Reviver #2 is one of a whole cadre of variations, and it follows the Corpse Reviver #1, which features cognac, calvados, and sweet vermouth. These revivers were initially devised as hangover cures, hence the name. While the drinks probably won't make you feel any less like a corpse after a long night out, they may help to raise you from the dead. And the Corpse Reviver #2 certainly tastes better in the morning than a lot of other classic cocktails. Soft and a little sour, it goes great with brunch.",

Gin, obviously, made that a little more appealing for the sailors of the day.The British Navy was always concerned about scurvy as well, so they needed a way to make sure their sailors consumed enough citrus. Their lime rations gave rise to a number of rum- and gin-based cocktails, eventually making their way into the Gin and Tonic. So, really, this started out as preventative medicine—kale smoothies be damned.",

It has long been a favorite at brunch, as it introduces some fresh, fruity flavors that pair fantastically with breakfast foods. While the Bellini has a reputation for being a bit of a girly drink, we think that's an old-fashioned idea—this is a cocktail that anyone can enjoy.Invented in 1945 at Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy, the Bellini was originally created to get rid of an excess of peaches bartender Giuseppe Cipriani had on hand. It gets its name from the Renaissance painter Giovanni Bellini, who is known for having brought rich, vivacious colors to the otherwise fairly muted style of the day—just like what this drink will bring to your brunch table.",

    "description": "A Whiskey and Coke is exactly what it sounds like: a simple two-ingredient cocktail comprised of whiskey and Coke. It's typically served in a rocks glass or Collins glass with ice.The drink is a popular call at bars, since you can get a Whiskey and Coke just about anywhere. It's also an easy cocktail to make at home. However, there's not one correct way to make the recipe, so that's where things can get interesting.Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is a popular choice when making a Whiskey and Coke. The same goes for American bourbons and Canadian whiskies—a Bourbon and Coke or a specific call for Crown and Coke (featuring Crown Royal) are both mainstays at bars. Depending on the type of whiskey you use, the flavor of your cocktail will change slightly. Some whiskeys are sweeter, spicier or drier than other varieties, which means you can experiment to find exactly what you're looking for.Some people like their Whiskey and Cokes stronger than others, so playing with the ratios is another easy way to accommodate your preference. One part whiskey to three parts Coke is a pretty standard ratio, but feel free to dial the mixer up or down to adjust the strength and flavor.The Whiskey and Coke isn't a complicated drink, but with its mixture of spirit, soda, and a caffeine kick, it's got staying power and remains one of the most popular mixed drinks in the world.",

    "description": "The Irish Coffee is a perfect drink for when you need to wake up halfway through a long night, or kick yourself out of bed and fight off a hangover. It's an exceedingly simple cocktail, consisting of just Irish whiskey, coffee, a bit of brown sugar simple syrup, and some heavy cream (preferably homemade). If you're looking for whiskey recommendations, be sure to check out our collection of the best Irish whiskey under $50.The Irish Coffee is eponymously served in a mug called an \"Irish Coffee Mug\". The style of mug most commonly used is the version with a side handle, but our preference is the more aesthetically-pleasing Georgian Irish Coffee Mug (pictured) as championed by both Jeffrey Morgenthaler and San Francisco's Buena Vista Cafe.The Irish Coffee was, unsurprisingly, invented in Ireland in the 1940s. It came to America by way of the Buena Vista Cafe in the early 1950s, and has been associated with the City by the Bay ever since.

    "description": "The Gimlet is a classic three-ingredient gin cocktail that tastes great and is simple to make. It is essentially a Gin Sour, and the Gimlet closely resembles its rum-based cousin the Daiquiri.Interestingly enough, both the Gimlet and the Daiquiri were supposedly employed by the British Navy to ensure that sailors got their daily rations of citrus, thereby keeping them safe from scurvy. (Originally, they just gave the sailors limes, but they couldn't actually get them to eat or drink the limes until booze was added to the rations).Thanks in part to the modern cocktail renaissance, bartenders have reinvented the Gimlet from its early days as a functional, medicinal drink on ships. Today it's a modern favorite served all over the world and counted among the drinking public's favorite gin cocktails, right up there with other classics like the Martini and Negroni.What's in a Gimlet cocktail?The classic Gimlet had only two ingredients—gin and lime juice. The early recipe from The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock specifically calls for Plymouth Gin. The same Gimlet recipe also calls for Rose's lime juice (formally called Rose's Lime Cordial)—a sweetened and bottled commercial lime juice. Because Rose's is a sweetened product, no additional sugar is necessary when using this recipe.Today, however, Gimlets are commonly made using a broad range of gins, fresh lime juice (because fresh-squeezed juices have the best flavors), and a bit of simple syrup. Moving away from the bottled lime juice dials back the sweetness and dials up the refreshment, making the Gimlet more suitable for modern palates.If you're not a fan of juniper or other botanicals in your alcohol, then the Vodka Gimlet may be more your speed. It is a popular alternative that's just as easy to make: substitutes vodka, a more neutral spirit, in lieu of the gin.How to Make a Gimlet CocktailTo make a Gin Gimlet, start by adding two ounces gin, a half ounce lime juice, and a half ounce simple syrup into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake vigorously until it's cold, then strain into a cocktail glass (aka a Martini glass). Alternatively, you can strain the mixture into a coupe glass for a softer and more modern presentation. Pro tip—pre-chill your glassware for best results. Finally, garnish with a lime wheel or a twist, and serve.",

    "description": "The Pineapple Upside-Down Cake cocktail is a fun riff on the delicious dessert. It features vanilla vodka, pineapple juice and grenadine, plus a maraschino cherry garnish. The vanilla vodka acts as the cake in this recipe, while the pineapple juice plays the role of the fruit. Grenadine, which is sunk to the bottom of the cocktail glass, creates the layered effect, with its bright-red color sitting below the pale yellow top.The Pineapple Upside-Down Cake drink is sweet, fruity, and easy to make. If you want to liven up the cocktail, try using fresh pineapple juice. Otherwise, Dole pineapple juice or another canned or bottled variety works just fine. To make the drink, add the vanilla vodka and pineapple juice a shaker with ice, shake until it's chilled, then strain the liquid into a cocktail glass. The last step is to slowly add the grenadine—it will sink to the bottom of the glass, which creates the layered effect you see in the photo.If you want a shooter version of the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, that can be arranged. The Pineapple Upside-Down Cake Shot is just as easy to make as the cocktail, but the recipe is dialed back slightly to create less volume, so the contents fit neatly into a shot glass.",

But this recipe adds apple juice to the equation, which amps up the apple flavor and tames the sweet, artificially flavored schnapps.The Apple Martini falls into a weird gray area between shaking and stirring. It has fruit juice, so by the general rule it should be shaken—but because it's apple juice, and that doesn't work as well when it gets frothy, this drink can also be stirred. ",

    "description": "The Sazerac is a classic New Orleans cocktail, and the official cocktail of New Orleans. It is recognized as one of the oldest cocktails, and in some circles it's arguably recognized as America's first cocktail.What's in a Sazerac cocktail?The original Sazerac recipe likely used cognac—a French brandy—as its base spirit. This cognac was called Sazerac de Forge et Fils, and is also where the cocktail derives its name. The cognac served as the main ingredient, and was mixed with Peychaud's bitters, absinthe or anise liqueur, and a sugar cube. This drink is typically garnished with a lemon peel spritzed over the top of the drink to release its oils, lending rich aromatics with each sip.In the ensuring years, the Sazerac recipe was modified to use rye whiskey, an occurrence widely attributed to a cognac shortage resulting from the European wine grape epidemic in the late 1800s. Since rye was plentiful and readily available in America, it assumed the mantle. Rye's trademark spice notes held up well to the rest of the Sazerac's ingredients, making rye a natural fit, and the recipe modification stuck.This combination would prove to be timeless—the Sazerac is a beloved classic that can be found at bars all over the world, alongside other classic whiskey cocktails like the Old-Fashioned and the Manhattan. The Sazerac has cemented its reputation as one of the most important drinks in American history.This modification to the recipe has carried over into modern times, with the rye whiskey version of the Sazerac being widely accepted today as the classic Sazerac recipe.The history of the SazeracThe invention of the Sazerac is often credited to Antoine Peychaud, a Creole immigrant and the owner of an apothecary in New Orleans in the 1830s, who came up with a liquid mixture of cognac, absinthe, sugar, and a tonic he created that later became known as his eponymous Peychaud's bitters. The drink was a hit.Back then, the Sazerac was served regularly in bars and saloons in the French Quarter, and it became the drink of choice at the Sazerac Coffee House. Eventually, it spread across the city and beyond, making its way to both shores and many places between.As lovely as that story sounds, and as widely accepted and retold as it is, it turns out the above narrative may be false. Hey, cocktails are often soaked in rumor and innuendo. Nevertheless, it makes for a fun read while you sip on a drink.What is definitely true is that the Sazerac has continued to shine over the years—and the modern cocktail renaissance has reintroduced it to many new drinkers, as the recipe finds itself on an endless array of cocktail menus around the world. In 2008, the Sazerac was recognized as the official cocktail of New Orleans, a city that still serves many fine examples of the drink.How to make a Sazerac cocktailThe Sazerac is a stirred drink that is traditionally served without ice. Start by adding a small rinse of absinthe or Herbsaint to an empty Old-Fashioned glass (aka rocks glass) until the inside of the glass is generously coated. Dump out the excess.Then add the rye whiskey (or cognac if you're feeling old-school) to a separate mixing glass with a few dashes of Peychaud's bitters, simple syrup, and ice. You can use a muddled sugar cube, but simple syrup creates a silkier texture without any gritty bits. Stir until well-chilled, and strain into that absinthe-rinsed Old-Fashioned glass. All that's left to do now is garnish your drink with a lemon twist.Popular whiskeys for a Sazerac cocktailThese days, rye whiskey is the spirit of choice for most Sazeracs. Any quality rye with bold flavor notes will work nicely, so feel free to use your favorite. We like a rye with a little heft to it, preferably something closer to 90 or 100 proof, but feel free to experiment.The Sazerac Company makes a great rye whiskey—Sazerac Rye Whiskey—that is a popular choice for Sazeracs, though it's not affiliated with the origin story of the Sazerac cocktail. We like Rittenhouse Rye, a bonded rye whiskey coming in at 100 proof, which adds a little extra stiffness against the backdrop of bitters and absinthe. Wild Turkey 101 will also treat you right.",

    "description": "The Gin Fizz is a classic gin cocktail made with simple syrup, lemon juice, soda water, and, optionally, egg white. It's probably the most famous fizz recipe, a category of drinks that are typically made with soda (hence the name), citrus, and sometimes egg white for texture (its cousin, the Ramos Gin Fizz, is another favorite). It's tart, rich, and has just a bit of bubbles, making it a crowd-pleaser for more than a century.The first printed recipe for the Gin Fizz (or any fizz, as far as we know) appeared in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas' seminal Bartender's Guide. It was popular throughout much of the 20th century, and has long been associated with the city of New Orleans.",

    "description": "Jungle Juice is a popular party drink that is often found at college parties and other festive gatherings. Rather than following one traditional recipe, Jungle Juice is a combination of spirits and juices, usually with a high alcohol content, that is made in large batches to serve a crowd.Jungle Juice is frequently served via a large container such as a punch bowl, a glass beverage dispenser with a spigot, a large pitcher, a cooler, or sometimes even a trashcan that's (hopefully) been fitted with a liner.What's in Jungle Juice?Jungle Juice doesn't have the best reputation. It's basically the opposite of a \"craft\" cocktail, and most recipes attempt to mask the taste of the hard alcohol with lots of sugary mixers.If your next party calls for Jungle Juice, try mixing up the recipe below. It features vodka, white rum, lemonade, fruit punch, and fruit juice for a result that's sweet and easy-drinking, but still strong.Other recipes may use different spirits such as gin or whiskey, other liqueurs such as triple sec or peach schnapps, and other mixers such as lemon juice, lime juice, lemon lime soda, Hawaiian Punch and soda water. Some recipes will also include additional ingredients or garnishes such as orange slices or lemon slices, strawberries, cherries and mint leaves.As you can see, there are no strict rules when making Jungle Juice. The basic premise is to throw a lot of ingredients into a large container, give it a quick stir and call it a day. Why is it called Jungle Juice, and who invented it?It would be easy to believe that this all-American drink was concocted by some ingenious college kid eager for fast intoxication at parties and desiring to make the taste of hard alcohol more palatable. But no.It's more likely that Jungle juice was \"invented\" by the US Army. It is believed that American soldiers in the jungle during World War II would combine available ingredients to ferment and flavor their beverages. They added what was available, relying on various juices, mixers and other ingredients they had on hand.According to Punch!, the first use of the term occurred in the October 25, 1945 issue of the New Yorker, where \"jungle juice\" was defined as \"a name loosely applied to any of the spirituous beverages that were concocted by American soldiers in the Southwest Pacific.\"So there you have it.Will Jungle Juice get me drunk?Whether or not Jungle Juice will get you drunk will depend on the ingredients and their proportions, as well as your individual alcohol tolerance. The base spirits are typically 40% ABV or higher, ensuring that your Jungle Juice starts at full-proof before mixers are added. If you want to make your punch with less alcohol, dial back the booze.The inclusion of orange juice, pineapple juice and various other mixers is intended to mask the hard liquor, thus making the drink taste better. It's plausible to think that if a drink tastes better, more of the drink would be consumed—and one thing's for sure, drinking enough of these will certainly get you tipsy, likely leading to a rough morning.Note that some people choose to use grain spirits like Everclear in their Jungle Juice. Considering that Everclear is an incredibly potent 95% ABV, we suggest sticking to vodka or other 40% ABV spirits. Either way, remember to pace yourself.",

    "description": "The Boulevardier is a classic variation on the Negroni. While the Negroni is composed of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, the Boulevardier subs in bourbon as its base spirit.The Boulevardier first appeared in bartender Harry McElhone's 1927 bar guide, Barflies and Cocktails. At the time, the American barman was slinging drinks in Paris at Harry's New York Bar due to a dark period of American history called Prohibition. That's where he met Erskine Gwynne, the creator of this drink, who edited a magazine called... The Boulevardier. Some Boulevardier recipes call for equal measures of each ingredient, while others kick things up a notch by doubling the whiskey. Our preferred recipe, though, mirrors Gwynne's, and uses 1.5 ounces of bourbon alongside one ounce each of Campari and sweet vermouth. So play around a bit to see what you like best. Either way, we recommend using a good sweet vermouth, like Carpano Antica or Dolin Rouge—something with enough heft to stand up alongside the strong whiskey and bitter Campari.If you like the Boulevardier, you'll want to try another Negroni variation called the Old Pal. That one also employs whiskey, but in this case, it calls for rye. And instead of sweet vermouth, it features the dry variety.",

You should always use fresh-squeezed lemon juice, as the bottled stuff doesn't taste nearly as good, and using simply syrup instead of sugar eliminated the issue of undissolved granules in the bottom of your glass.You're welcome to add an egg white if you want a frothier, creamier drink, just make sure you do a dry shake (a hard shake without ice to emulsify the egg) at the start of the recipe.",

    "description": "The Vesper is a spirit-forward cocktail that is the first Martini James Bond ordered in Casino Royale. It's distinctive in that it includes both gin and vodka, in addition to the French aperitif, Lillet Blanc, which takes the place of dry vermouth.The Vesper is an original recipe from author Ian Fleming. In the book, and subsequent movie, Bond orders the drink with explicit instructions: \"Three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.\"Now, we hate to argue with Fleming (and Bond), but drinks composed of all spirits are traditionally stirred. It's well-known that Bond likes his Martinis shaken, but we suggest stirring the Vesper to keep its texture and appearance silky smooth.",

    "description": "If you're a fan of the cereal Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and you just happen to fancy the same flavor in a libation, then this Cinnamon Toast Crunch recipe is for you. It's fun, sweet, and spicy, so it's a perfect choice for parties, happy hours and other events where shots aren't out of place.Rumchata and FireballBelieve it or not, the Cinnamon Toast Crunch shot is a simple combination of just two ingredients: Rumchata and Fireball whiskey. When mixed together, the duo has a flavor that is very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal, and some fans of this drink have experienced feelings of deja-vu while waxing nostalgic about their childhood.You can shake the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Shot with ice and strain it into a couple shot glasses, knocking the drink back quickly in one go, or you can pour the drink into a rocks glass or cocktail glass, if you want to enjoy it more slowly. Either way, try accenting the drink with a cinnamon sugar rim for a little extra flavor with each sip.Fireball and RumchataFireball is a 33% ABV cinnamon whiskey that combines Canadian whisky, cinnamon flavoring and sweeteners. It is the best-selling cinnamon flavored whiskey and among the best-selling whiskeys in the United States, by volume. Rumchata is a 13.75% ABV cream liqueur made from rum, dairy cream, cinnamon, vanilla, sugar, and other flavorings. It's the second best-selling cream liqueur after Bailey's, and the name is a play on horchata, the traditional Mexican rice drink. Put them together in equal parts, give it all a shake in a cocktail shaker, and you get this fun concoction.If you make the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cocktail and think it needs a bit more vanilla flavor to mirror the cereal, try adding a touch of vanilla vodka to the recipe alongside that Rumchata and Fireball. You can add it in the same proportions as the other ingredients, and this will boost the alcohol content while also lending more of that vanilla sweetness you crave.To Each Their OwnWe don't quite get the allure of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch drink ourselves. When we crave Cinnamon Toast Crunch we eat a bowl of cereal, and when we crave booze we drink booze—but this mixed drink certainly seems to enjoy some popularity. So hey, to each their own.",

And if you use citrus vodka and a splash of cranberry juice, you've got yourself a Cosmopolitan!By some accounts (notably that of cocktail historian Dave Wondrich), the Kamikaze shot was the original shooter. According to his research, it was invented in 1976, making it one of the true \"disco cocktails\" of that oh-so-maligned era. Compared to some of its contemporaries, though, the Kamikaze is a downright sophisticated drink, and it's certainly salvageable if you know what you're doing.",

It's like an Irish Manhattan, but with dry vermouth instead of sweet, and with the addition of absinthe or Pernod.The directness of the Irish whiskey complements the refined, herbal flavors of the vermouth and absinthe, giving it a mature and balanced taste. Stir for maximum clarity and garnish with the twisted rind of an orange.A note about the vermouth: In Harry Johnson's Bartender's Manual (1900 edition) and the famed Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), dry vermouth is the preferred choice for the Blackthorn Cocktail—and it's used in equal portions to the whiskey. But in more recent recipe iterations, it's common to see sweet vermouth employed instead. Both make for a good drink, but we like how the dry vermouth plays with the absinthe. Feel free to experiment with vermouths and ratios to find what you like best. We've enjoyed an even split between sweet and dry vermouths, so there's room to play around.",

    "description": "The classic Vodka Gimlet is simply a vodka-based variation on the Gimlet, which is traditionally made with gin. It's light, refreshing, and easy to make. Where the gin can sometimes be too complex or strongly flavored for some drinkers, substituting vodka gives rise to a smooth, straightforward drink that is equally at home on hot summer days by the pool and relaxing nights at home.What's in a Vodka Gimlet cocktail?The Vodka Gimlet recipe is most closely related to the Daiquiri, which is a nearly identical recipe, but made with rum instead of vodka. Both the Daiquiri and Gimlet were enjoyed by the English Navy to ensure British sailors got their daily rations of citrus, thereby warding off scurvy, an ailment that arises from a lack of vitamin C in the diet.The recipe is incredibly simple with only three ingredients: vodka, lime juice, and simple syrup. It's recommend to use a quality vodka, though there's no need to pick up anything too expensive—just choose something you like and steer clear of the super cheap stuff. A good, medium-priced vodka should serve you well and make a great Gimlet. Fortunately, vodka is an affordable category, with several great bottles available for around $20.Although many old-school recipes suggest Rose's Lime Cordial, we always think that fresh is best. Try using fresh lime juice for a more flavorful and better tasting cocktail.How to Make a Vodka Gimlet CocktailTo make a Vodka Gimlet, start by pouring two ounces vodka, a half ounce lime juice, and a half ounce simple syrup into a cocktail shaker.Add ice, shake vigorously for about 20 seconds, then strain your drink into a chilled cocktail glass—aka a Martini glass. Alternatively, use a coupe glass instead for a softer, rounder, and more modern aesthetic. Optionally garnish with a lime wheel (some people also add a mint leaf), and serve.The Vodka Gimlet in Popular CultureThis Vodka Gimlet was a favorite of Betty Draper on Mad Men, making it a perfect drink for period-piece parties. Hers would have used Rose's Lime, but as we noted above, yours will present its best self when mixed with fresh lime juice. Ernest Hemingway and Philip Marlowe, the protagonist in Raymond Chandler's detective novels, also drank Gimlets, but they served theirs with gin.Of course, once you've mastered the Vodka Gimlet, it's just a quick spirits swap to make the classic Gin Gimlet, so go ahead and try both to see which you prefer.",

As she is the youngest of seven children, the Nancy Pelosi cocktail features a total of seven ingredients to pay tribute to her and her siblings.",

    "description": "The Four Horsemen drink (or 4 Horsemen Shot) is a simple shooter that combines four varieties of whiskey—bourbon whiskey, Tennessee whiskey, Scotch whiskey, and Irish whiskey—used in equal-parts and served in a shot glass.Why is this drink called the Four Horsemen?It is named for the most popular brands of each type of whiskey that comprise the drink's ingredients: Jim Beam, Jack Daniel's, Johnnie Walker, and Jameson (named for John Jameson), all of whom come together like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. A bit cheeky if you ask us, but it's fun to consider that these top-selling spirits all feature gentleman whose names begin with \"J.\"What alcohol is in a Four Horsemen shot?As far as we can tell, the original recipe for the Four Horsemen shot includes only whiskeys, and only the aforementioned whiskey brands.Some recipes found online include Jose Cuervo, which is a tequila and therefore ruins that whiskey streak. Other recipes call for all kinds of additional ingredients including Grand Marnier, Jagermeister, Bacardi, Captain Morgan, or even (gasp) sour mix, which sort of defeats the purpose of the name. If you see anyone calling for everclear or a method that involves flames, you may want to steer clear. When in doubt, stick to the classic four ingredients and nothing else.How to make a Four Horsemen shot?Some variations of the Four Horsemen recipe suggest shaking all the whiskeys with ice in a cocktail shaker to chill the shot, which you can do. But if you don't want to dilute the spirits, then there's no need to shake, stir or strain anything. Either drink the shot at room temperature, or chill the bottles before you make the Four Horsemen shot to enjoy it ice-cold.When making this drink, we suggest keeping it simple with the original Four Horsemen recipe. Just pour equal parts of each whiskey into a shot glass or lowball glass, and you're done. Easy peasy.Is the Four Horsemen shot strong?The Four Horsemen shot is often misperceived as an extra-strong drink made from hard liquors with high alcoholic content, but it is in fact no stronger than any other straight shot of whiskey, provided you're consuming an equal portion of liquid. Because, at the end of the day, you're still shooting two ounces of whiskey (per the usual half-ounce pour of each), regardless of how many whiskeys go into the glass. Of course, you should use caution whenever you're downing shots, but you already knew that.Does the Four Horsemen shot taste good?While the novelty of the name and the multi-part drink can certainly be fun, we're not sure we see the point in mixing a bunch of whiskeys together to create this shooter. Perhaps for the same questionable reason someone came up with the Three Wise Men shot—but hey, to each their own. If you like it, drink it!Combining four different whiskey brands in a single shot won't make you any more drunk when you're consuming the same volume of alcohol. But it's a fun way to work through some bottles in your home bar.",

The Campari does its jobs, providing a punch of bitterness, and the dry vermouth provides a floral unifier to tie it all together. The final result is a stiff drink that can be sipped before dinner as an aperitif, or indulged in fireside, proving its value as a versatile addition to your drinking arsenal. ",

All you need is a blender, a few basic kitchen staples, brandy, rum, and a few hours for it to chill in the fridge. It makes two servings, but you can easily increase the yield by multiplying your ingredients by however people you want to serve. Once you've mastered this recipe, mix things up with the Whiskey Eggnog, which is even easier to make, requiring nothing more than a shaker, strainer, and glass.",

We recommend using a strong, spicy ginger beer, as it's really the star of the show, but unlike the original recipe, the Kentucky Mule's use of bourbon gives it a slightly sweeter, oakier profile that shines through the soda better than vodka.The Kentucky Mule follows the naming conventions of other drinks that freely swap their base spirits, adopting its title from the home of bourbon itself. It's a great cocktail for those hot summer days when you don't really feel like drinking a Mint Julep, but still want to feel like a genteel Southerner.",

    "description": "The Moscow Mule is an approachable and popular vodka cocktail that comes from a family of cocktails known as the \"buck\"—a drink made with ginger beer, citrus, and a base spirit.Served in eye-catching copper mugs, easy to drink, and made with readily available ingredients, the Moscow Mule cocktail has enjoyed a spot near the top of the modern cocktail canon. It's easy to see why; it's tasty, refreshing and great on hot summer days or a night out on the town.What's in a Moscow Mule?The Moscow Mule is composed of just three ingredients—vodka, lime juice, and ginger beer—so it's very easy to make. Like all classic cocktails, we recommend using fresh juice, as the final product will taste far superior to anything made with bottled lime juice or certainly sweet-and-sour.The best ginger beer is up for debate, but choosing a high-quality product will go a long way in this recipe. Some ginger beers have a bolder flavor that others, with more sweetness or spicy notes, so feel free to experiment with a few different brands until you find one that makes the best Moscow Mule for you. Two of our favorites here at Bevvy are Fever Tree Ginger Beer and Q Ginger Beer, but there are many great options on store shelves.Importantly, do not be confused and substitute ginger ale for the ginger beer, as it's a different mixer that will result in a different drink. You want the robust spice of real ginger beer.A common garnish for the Moscow Mule is a lime wedge, but a sprig of mint has also been well-received. You can experiment with other garnishes, or skip the garnish entirely—you really can't go wrong here.The recipe below is for the classic Moscow Mule, but there are plenty of Moscow Mule variations for those who want to experiment. For example, the Kentucky Mule calls for bourbon whiskey instead of vodka, while the Mexican Mule uses tequila, and Audrey Saunders—owner of the dearly departed New York bar, Pegu Club—slips gin into her beloved Gin-Gin Mule.Who invented the Moscow Mule?The traditional Moscow Mule cocktail is widely believed to have been invented as the result of a 1941 collaboration between three men: John G. Martin, who had recently purchased the rights to the Smirnoff vodka brand; Jack Morgan, the owner and proprietor of Cock'n Bull ginger beer; and Rudolph Kunett, former rights holder to the Smirnoff brand.Martin and Kunett were struggling to sell Smirnoff in a post-second World War America, as Americans didn't know the first thing about vodka and it was largely unpopular. Morgan was struggling to sell an overzealous order of ginger beer. The trio, perhaps in desperation, concocted a drink recipe combining their products and devised a marketing campaign to sell the cocktail. They struck gold with the fortuitous concoction served in an eye-catching copper mug.The Moscow Mule helped to popularize vodka in the United States for decades to come. (The full history of the Moscow Mule is a fascinating one and worth a read if you're a fan of the drink).Why is a Moscow Mule served in a copper mug?The Moscow Mule's signature copper mug played a part in the intrigue and ensuing popularity of the Moscow Mule. That much is a fact. What remains relatively mysterious is who was responsible for the idea of using a copper cup in the first place.One account includes an unnamed woman who was struggling to sell her handmade mugs. Supposedly, she happened to know one of the drink's inventors—and was possibly even a girlfriend—but the rest of the story is quite murky. Another account claims the then-head bartender of Cock ‘n’ Bull restaurant in LA created the Moscow Mule as a way to use up an excess supply of ginger beer and mugs, and had the cocktail on the menu for a while before his boss and associates took credit for inventing it. Like a lot of cocktail history, the origin story is not entirely clear, but Price’s account seems a bit more likely, if less intriguing.Regardless of who invented the original Moscow Mule recipe, Martin was the one who picked it up and ran with it, embarking on a tour of bars across the United States with a mountain of bright copper mugs and one of the earliest Polaroid cameras in tow.He would show up at a bar, get the bartender to make his Moscow Mule for guests, and then take a picture of them with his camera. Other guests, fascinated by the snazzy copper cups, would inquire and often order the same cocktail for themselves.Martin would then leave one copy of the photograph with the bar to display, and take the other—along with many more like it—to the next bar. It was a serious case of “all the cool kids are doing it” marketing, and it was extremely effective in popularizing the Moscow Mule.While the copper mug is fun and frosty, you don't necessarily need one to enjoy the drink. Other glassware options for serving Moscow Mules include the highball glass and the Collins glass. They may not look quite as interesting, but the drink will be equally delicious.Safety tip: When using a copper Moscow Mule mug, always look for options that are coated with a food safe lacquer or lined with another metal, like stainless steel. Unlined copper mugs—and other containers like shakers—can leach copper into drinks, especially if they are acidic and the liquid remains in contact with the copper vessel for a long period of time.",

Gosling's official trademark states that it is for \"Pre-mixed alcoholic cocktail, namely rum and ginger beer,\" which is just ambiguous enough to cause confusion.

    "description": "The Vodka Tonic is one of those wonderfully self-explanatory mixed drinks, like a Gin and Tonic or Rum and Coke. The tonic water allows some room for variation and experimentation, though, so check out the lesser-known tonic brands at your local liquor store before settling for the likes of Canada Dry and Schweppes—brands such as Fever Tree, Q Tonic and Fentiman's have much higher-quality products and will make for a superior drink. You can even get creative and mix your own from a tonic syrup, which can be fun to give the Vodka Tonic cocktail more of a DIY element.One of the easiest ways to change the taste and flavor of this most simple of vodka cocktails is to switch up the garnish. Although it's classically finished with a lime wedge, drinkers might opt for another citrus like lemon wedge or orange, berries or even a squeeze of lime juice (but not that much lime juice—the vodka gimlet is its own drink).Drinkers who are calorie conscious can also swap out the tonic water in favor or soda water to make it a vodka and soda.",

    "name": "Vodka Collins",
    "description": "The Vodka Collins is a simple vodka-based cocktail that's typically served in a Collins Glass (the latter was named after the drink it so often contained).The Vodka Collins recipe is a riff on the Collins-family of cocktails, such as the classic gin-laced John Collins and Tom Collins—the former was made with London dry gin while the latter was traditionally made with Old Tom Gin, hence the name. The Tom Collins dates back to at least 1877, when it appeared in The Bon Vivant's Companion by famed barkeep Jerry Thomas. In this family tree of Collins-cocktails, the Vodka Collins is known as the Joe Collins. But you don't need to worry about that. In fact, try ordering a Joe Collins at the bar, and the average barkeep will give you a blank stare. Right, so, Vodka Collins it is.What's in a Vodka Collins?The Vodka Collins recipe consists of a couple of ounces of vodka, lemon juice (fresh is best), sweetener, and sparkling water (club soda or seltzer water). The spirit acts as a solid backbone, while the lemon brightens the drink and the sparkling water lends effervescence. Many Vodka Collins recipes will also include a cherry garnish (or a lemon slice) for a nice presentation, but this is optional—the drink tastes just as good without it.Our preference for the sweetener is to use basic simple syrup, as it mixes well and does not impart additional flavors, but bartenders may selectively choose an alternative sweetener for their own recipe variations. For the cherry garnish, we like using a high-quality maraschino cherry if available, rather than the bright-red versions packed in preservatives.We do not recommend using sweetened versions of soda water substitutes such as Cherry 7up or Sprite, which we've seen in some Vodka Collins recipes elsewhere online—that adds empty calories, but more importantly, it messes with the flavor profile of the classic drink.How to make a Vodka Collins?Many bartenders will build a Vodka Collins directly in the glass, adding each ingredient, plus ice cubes, and giving it all a quick stir. It appears this was the original way of making the drink. However, you can also shake it with ice in a cocktail shaker to better incorporate the ingredients. Just know that this method brings additional dilution into your glass, so you may need to dial back the sparkling water slightly. Whichever route you choose, the result is a delicious and refreshing drink",

Some of you might even want to try modifying the Elderflower Martini recipe by using an Old Tom gin instead of a traditional London Dry gin, as it's a bit sweeter and less powerful on the juniper.",

It's typically either built in an Old-Fashioned glass on the rocks, or stirred and served up in a cocktail or coupe glass. A London dry gin typically balances the other flavors best, and be sure to use a good sweet vermouth like Carpano Antica or Noilly Prat.The Negroni was probably invented around 1905 by one Count Count Camillo Negroni, an Italian noble who had abandoned his home country for the adventure of the American Wild West. Upon returning to Florence after decades of hard living, he ordered an Americano cocktail—Campari, sweet vermouth, and soda water—but instead of the traditional soda, he requested a measure of gin for a bit more kick. There's some controversy surrounding the history of the Negroni, though, and it certainly makes for a hell of a tale.",

    "name": "Vodka Martini",
    "description": "The Vodka Martini is, as the name would imply, simply a variation of the classic Dry Martini that uses vodka instead of gin. It makes for a very different drink, in which the aromas from the vermouth are more pronounced relative to those of the spirit, as vodka does not contain the botanicals found in gin. And, as a bonus, the Vodka Martini lets you order a sexy-looking Martini even if you can't stand the thought of drinking gin.What's in a Vodka Martini?Crucially, vodka. It will also contain dry vermouth (sometimes called \"French vermouth\"). The ratios between the vodka and the vermouth will vary according to the recipe and client preferences; the driest of dry Vodka Martinis might only have a vermouth wash, while \"wetter\" Vodka Martinis could hold a whole ounce of vermouth or more.It will typically be accompanied by a garnish, though this will also differ according to customer preference. A lemon twist might be added for a touch of citrus tang, a skewer of olives can provide a briny touch and turn it into a Dirty Vodka Martini, and cocktail onions can make it a Vodka Gibson.The history of the Vodka MartiniAs is the case with many classic cocktails, the precise origins of the Martini—whether that's a classic Gin Martini or the Vodka Martini—are shrouded in mystery. Some sources claim that the drink derived its name from a brand of vermouth called Martini, while other suggest it was a riff on the Martinez cocktail.What's not in doubt is that James Bond, in the original novels and the subsequent films, did perhaps more than any bartender to promote the Vodka Martini, with his famous \"shaken, not stirred\" order. How's that for an advertisement?How to make a Vodka Martini To make a Vodka Martini, first gather the necessary ingredients: vodka and vermouth, and depending on your garnish preferences, olives, a lemon peel, or a cocktail onion.Make sure your tools are at hand, also. You'll want a cocktail mixing glass (or a cocktail shaker, should you want to take Bond's advice to heart), plus a stirring spoon, ice cubes, and a chilled Martini glass. As the Vodka Martini is a drink that benefits from a frosty temperature, you may want to keep that cocktail glass in the freezer for at least 20 minutes before before you pour the finished cocktail into it. Popular vodkas for a Vodka MartiniThe choice of what vodka should be used in a Vodka Martini rests with the drinker, depending on their own flavor preferences. Tito's and Grey Goose may be two of the most commonly asked-for vodka brands, although these days 007 is partial to Belvedere.",

The club was famous for inviting politicians and other personalities of note, requiring them to give a speech after dinner, and then heckling them incessantly.

Considered the Godfather of Tennessee Whiskey, it was Green who first taught a young, orphaned Jack Daniel how to distill whiskey all those years ago.From there, you get a well-balanced mix of maple syrup, allspice dram, and bitters, plus a pinch of salt to further bring out those flavors.",

Angostura is the most obvious choice, but mixing things up is an easy way to tweak the cocktail.Here we've got a mostly classic version from STK Downtown, the New York steakhouse. The barkeeps are using George Dickel Rye alongside the rich and flavorful Carpano Antica Formula, an Italian sweet vermouth. All that is accented with two types of bitters—Angostura and Peychaud's.

    "description": "The Old-Fashioned cocktail is a simple drink, consisting of bourbon whiskey or rye whiskey, sugar or simple syrup, Angostura bitters, and an orange twist, over ice.The cocktail dates back to the turn of the nineteenth century, the very dawn of the word “cocktail” itself—and is often regarded as the most essential of the classic cocktails, if not the best-known whiskey drink of all time. James Beard, the well-known American culinary icon, considered the Old-Fashioned one of the best of cocktails.Classic Old-Fashioned Cocktail RecipeCocktail aficionados have long argued about the \"proper\" recipe for an Old-Fashioned. Sugar cube or simple syrup? Orange twist or muddled fruit? A large cube of ice or something else? At Bevvy, our preferred Old-Fashioned calls for the simpler formula of the \"classic recipe\"—consisting of whiskey, sugar, and bitters over a large cubed ice—there'll be no muddled fruit or bright cherries. That being said, the recipe below is very close to what people would have been drinking back when it was first invented in the 1800s.This Old-Fashioned recipes call for building your drink in the glass, but an alternate method involves stirring the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass before straining them into the serving glass.Who invented the Old-Fashioned cocktail?Among those that have laid claim to inventing the Old-Fashioned, the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky may be the best known and has been credited to have created the drink—but this claim has been debunked. Many other attempted claims have also been debunked, some due to strange recipes, others to date and timeline inconsistencies.The first known recipe for the Old-Fashioned is from a Chicago bartender named Theodore Proulx, in his book The Bartender's Manual, but even still a connection has never been made that Chicago was the Old-Fashioned's birthplace, nor Proulx the creator.So who did invent the Old-Fashioned? We may never know for sure. As Robert Simonson said in his book The Old-Fashioned: The Story of the World's First Classic Cocktail, with Recipes and Lore: \"[The history of] the Old-Fashioned is a much more complicated case. Being an outgrowth of the Whiskey Cocktail, it evolved more than it arrived. Claiming that one bartender created it is a bit like saying a single person invented jazz.\"",

From there, you're still employing coconut cream and pineapple juice as your mixers, and serving the drink in a Hurricane glass, if you've got one. If not, any tall glass will do. The Vodka Piña Colada can be shaken with ice and then served with ice in your glass. Or it can be blended. If you'd like to do the latter, just add all of your ingredients to a blender with ice, and blend until smooth. Garnish with a slice of pineapple and an optional cherry, and you're ready to enjoy this fun and tropical cocktail.",

Some years ago, when he was overworking, he used to come into the bar and say, 'Coley, I am tired. Give me something with a bit of punch in it.' It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, 'By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!' And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since.\"",

He taught Jack Daniel how to distill, so clearly he's had a major impact on the whiskey world.The whiskey itself makes for a good sipper, but it also works well in cocktails. Case in point: the Highview that you see here. It's named after the cemetery in which Green is buried and comes from California barkeep Nick Priedite, who whipped this up for The Lark in Santa Barbara. The cocktail combines Uncle Nearest with Italicus (a bergamot-flavored aperitif) and Branca Menta, the minty cousin to Fernet-Branca. It's strong and complex, but still refreshing—perfect for a late-summer drink or to fortify yourself against the colder months to come.",

Fresh lime keeps the sweetness in check and a dash of coconut water adds extra refreshment.Call for the Hula Daiquiri at Savanna Rooftop, or try mixing one up at home with the below recipe.

But it's this mezcal-and-tequila-spiked drink that's grabbed our attention of late. The Escorpión combines the aforementioned agave spirits, plus apricot liqueur, citrus, bitters, and orgeat for a smoky, tiki-inspired drink that's perfect for fighting the summer heat.That said, the cocktail gives off some heat of its own via a lime shell full of flaming 151-proof rum. So... be sure to blow that out before drinking, lest you lose an eyebrow.",

It's considered by some to be a variation on the Gin Sour, and is similar to the Blue Moon cocktail, the Moonlight cocktail, and the Casino cocktail. The Aviation cocktail was invented by Hugo Ensslin, a bartender at the Hotel Wallick in New York in the early 1900's, and first appeared in his 1916 book Recipes for Mixed Drinks. The crème de violette gives the Aviation a pale, sky-blue color (hence the name).",

    "description": "The Midori Sour is a popular cocktail distinguished by its melon flavor and bright green color. Originating in the disco clubs of the late 1970s, the Midori Sour enjoyed an impressive run through the '80s and '90s. Today, it has lost some of its original luster, especially as bars and consumers have moved toward craft cocktails. But it deserves an appreciative nod for its ubiquity over the decades, as it served millions of drinkers across the globe.What's in a Midori Sour?The Midori Sour cocktail is a riff on classic sour cocktails, a family of mixed drinks that contain a base spirit, citrus, and a sweetener.The traditional Midori Sour features Midori Melon Liqueur—a Japanese honeydew melon liqueur produced by Suntory, plus a sour component, sugar and club soda. The liqueur is where the cocktail gets its name. It also happens to be where it gets its color, as \"midori\" is the Japanese word for green. Midori liqueur is quite sweet. And many drinks originating in the 1970s and '80s, including the Midori Sour, called for sour mix—typically from a soda gun—which is cloyingly sweet, artificially sour and just not great. Fortunately, bartenders since then have embraced fresh ingredients during the modern craft cocktail renaissance.These days, creative bartenders are making efforts to update the Midori Sour recipe. This usually includes skipping the bottled, store-bought sour mix in favor of fresh juices, which creates a markedly better drink.The New Midori SourFor the Midori Sour recipe below, we use fresh lemon juice combined with simple syrup to make homemade sour mix. Our preference here is to use lemons, but you can also mix lemon and lime juice in a 50/50 ratio for a lemon-lime kick. Experiment with the citrus to see which taste you prefer.Once your ingredients are set, pour everything except the soda water into a rocks glass or Collins glass, add ice, and stir. There's no need to shake this drink in a cocktail shaker, as that brings in extra dilution that will alter the balance of the cocktail.Optionally, you may add an ounce of vodka to the mix if you want a stronger drink, since the melon liqueur is a lower-proof alcohol.Finally, add a splash of soda water to add refreshing effervescence and to temper the sweetness. Some cocktail recipes suggest using a lemon lime soda, such as Sprite, but we don't recommend going that route, as it will alter the flavor and add more sugar to the recipe.The cocktail may now be served as-is, or if you wish to garnish your Midori Sour, feel free to add a lemon wedge, lime slice or even a maraschino cherry. Whatever makes you happy.",

For some Old-Fashioned purists, it represents an affront to all the progress made in the last few years of the cocktail renaissance.But for others, particularly those from its home state of Wisconsin, it's a classic that deserves recognition in its own right. Our verdict? This is a separate drink entirely, and that's just fine. That said, you're free to break the rules. If you'd like to use brandy but are a staunch member of the no-fruit camp, go for it—the result is spirited and more akin to the whiskey-spiked version.",

    "description": "One of those great classic cocktails that are simply amazing when properly made, the Ramos Gin Fizz is a citrus-forward cocktail — deliciously balanced between sweet, sour, and acidity — with a foamy yet airy mouthfeel.The Ramos Gin Fizz cocktail has a storied history. Invented at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans in 1888 by Henry C. Ramos, the Ramos Gin Fizz was originally called the New Orleans Fizz before being eponymously known for its creator.The Ramos Gin Fizz is not an easy drink to make. Aside from the long list of ingredients (including the irreplaceable but harder to find orange flower water), the light silky texture of the cocktail requires vigorous shaking to aerate the cream and egg white combo. Legend has it that Henry Ramos employed dozens of \"shaker boys\" whose sole purpose is to shake orders of Ramos Gin Fizz after the bartender has prepared the drink, for as long as 12 minutes by some accounts!Perhaps due to the immense and almost immediate popularity of the cocktail when it was first introduced, the Ramos Gin Fizz recipe was rumored to be a closely guarded secret. However, once America entered Prohibition, the recipe became publicly available which we are thankful for today.",

It takes the mint and soda water of the former, and the gin of the latter, to create a delicious hybrid. Then again, maybe it's more of a mint-spiked Tom Collins. No matter how you want to look at it, the Southside is a popular summer cocktail that you'll find dotting country club menus all over the northeastern U.S.Its favor among the preppy sporting class eventually expanded, and now you can find the Southside in cocktail bars across the country. Seek it out, or make one for yourself, and you'll see why it's been enjoyed for decades. The mixture of gin, citrus, mint, and soda is a winning combination that you can drink all summer long.",

Fentimans or Reed's work great, but even if you can't find those, make sure that you're using ginger beer, never ginger ale. Otherwise it's not an Irish Mule.",

    "name": "Manhattan",
    "description": "The Manhattan cocktail is simple, elegant and sophisticated. Included on the IBA (International Bartender Association) list of official cocktails, it's a true classic, right up there with other favorites like the Old Fashioned, Negroni and Martini. Since its creation, the Manhattan has has remained a favorite among bartenders around the world. But while the classic recipe is still beloved, the drink has spurred many popular variations that have attained their own following and fame.What's in a Manhattan Cocktail?The Manhattan recipe calls for three ingredients—whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters—plus a garnish.For the best Manhattan cocktails, we like using a good rye whiskey, but many drinkers use bourbon or other types of whiskey. Feel free to experiment with your favorite brands, and take note of the nuances each plays in creating the drink's overall flavor profile. Some folks prefer the sweeter flavor of bourbon, while others like the spicier flavor of rye. Both spirits make great drinks.When choosing your sweet vermouth, reach for a top-quality bottle, such as Noilly Prat Rouge, Carpano Antica, or Dolin Rouge, to bring additional depth to the cocktail. The classic Manhattan recipe also calls for two to three dashes of Angostura bitters, which lend balance and complexity.As for the garnish, most people opt for a cherry (or occasionally an orange peel), but stay away from the bright, fluorescent options commonly found on top of sundaes. Instead, choose a gourmet offering, like a jar of Luxardo cherries. They're more expensive, but they're worth it, turning the garnish into a delicious treat that complements the total package, rather than a simple afterthought.Manhattan VariationsPopular variations of the Manhattan cocktail include the Rob Roy, which uses scotch instead of American whiskey, the Perfect Manhattan, which uses equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, and the Brandy Manhattan, which substitutes brandy for whiskey.Still other recipe variations include a host of New York-named drinks, like the Red Hook and the Brooklyn, which are classics in their own right. Both call for a dash of maraschino liqueur, while the latter uses dry vermouth instead of sweet vermouth. The Manhattan template is ripe for experimentation, so you're likely to find a unique spin on the classic recipe on bar menus all over the world.How to make a Manhattan CocktailThe classic Manhattan cocktail is a stirred drink that's traditionally served up. Add two ounces of whiskey, one ounce of sweet vermouth, and Angostura bitters to a mixing glass with fresh ice, and stir until the liquids are properly chilled. Then strain the contents into a pre-chilled cocktail glass (a coupe glass or Nick and Nora glass will also work nicely here), and finally garnish with a maraschino cherry.Note the drink is stirred, not shaken. Shaking a Manhattan introduces too much dilution into the cocktail and also affects the drink's texture, creating little ice shards that ruin the silky smooth aesthetic. So put the cocktail shaker away, and instead grab a bar spoon and mixing glass.Who invented the Manhattan Cocktail?The Manhattan cocktail traces its roots to the late 19th century and was likely invented in New York City, hence the name. The famed Manhattan Club claims that it created the first Manhattan, and this may be true. One reports says that it was stirred into creation at a party for Lady Randolph Churchill (Winston Churchill's mother) in 1874, but research by cocktail historian David Wondrich seems to disprove the story. More likely, the Manhattan as we know it came about sometime in the 1860s or 1870s. It's easy to imagine the cocktail popping up at multiple places during this period, as whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters were all popular and readily available.Regardless of when it was first concocted, this is one of the most legendary whiskey cocktails in the world. Try one today and see why, 150 years after its creation, it's just as popular as ever.",

Membership was limited to those who were unanimously approved by the existing members, determined anonymously by each person placing a white or black marble into a jar. A single black marble meant that the applicant would be denied, giving rise to the phrase \"blackballed.\"In more recent years, the Pegu Club cocktail is most closely affiliated with Audrey Saunders' pioneering New York cocktail bar by the same name, the Pegu Club, an establishment that eschews its forebear's exclusionary practices for a welcoming vibe and expertly-made drinks.The modern Pegu Club's alumni roster is a who's who of the cocktail world, many of whom have gone on to open iconic bars of their own—including Jim Meehan of PDT, Tony Maloney of Violet Hour, Phil Ward of Mayahuel, Chad Solomon of Midnight Rambler, and many others.Sadly, the Pegu Club announced on April 30, 2020 it was closing its doors for good, largely due to devastating conditions for restaurants and bars created by the coronavirus pandemic.",

It's a simple recipe, and as a result it's hard to tell exactly where it comes from—like so many other one-ingredient additions or subtractions, the Colorado Bulldog was probably invented many times over before anyone settled on a name. A number of cocktail journalists have put out calls to see who claims to have concocted it first, and if anyone has any idea what this drink has to do with Colorado or bulldogs, but to no avail.As a drink, the Colorado Bulldog is certainly tasty, if a bit indulgent. The combination of cream, cola, and coffee liqueur isn't exactly low-calorie (or \"craft,\" really, depending on your definition), but it makes for an interesting and sultry-sweet blend of creaminess and carbonation. Perfect as a dessert drink, or simply for those who have grown tired of the classic White Russian, the Colorado Bulldog is definitely worth a taste.",

    "description": "The Adios Motherfucker cocktail (or the AMF drink, in mixed company), despite its vulgar name, is basically just a Long Island Iced Tea with two ingredients swapped: blue curaçao instead of triple sec, and a splash of lemon-lime soda instead of cola. The name is a holdover from the bad old days of the late 20th century, when cocktails went for shock value over quality. The Adios Motherfucker has long been a favorite at nightclubs, where it's typically viewed as an efficient way to get smashed (despite containing a pretty standard 2 oz of spirits), but in recent years its popularity has waned thanks to the growth of the craft cocktail movement.While electric blue drinks don't have a great reputation among bartenders, the Adios Motherfucker actually goes down pretty easy, all things considered. You can class it up a bit by using fresh lemon juice and simple syrup instead of sour mix (a practice we endorse pretty much unequivocally), but save the nice bottles of booze for something else—a subtle aged rum, a craft gin, and a premium tequila are just going to get lost in the shuffle of the Adios Motherfucker's mixers.",

The Tom Collins is served in, you guessed it, a Collins glass, which is narrower than a typical highball. A nice side effect of this glassware is that when you tilt the drink all the way back to get those last few drops, the ice is a lot less likely to spill down the front of your shirt. But hey, come July, that might not be so bad!The origins of the Tom Collins recipe is a bit murky, but it seems likely that it was invented in England sometime in the early 19th century. That said, the Tom Collins cocktail first appeared in print in the 1876 edition of American barman Jerry Thomas' How to Mix Drinks.For a quick changeup, use vodka in place of gin, and you get the easygoing Vodka Collins.",

All that makes for a fine addition to cocktails that you don't have to fuss with too much, as evidenced here. The Rosa Martini is a simple mix of tequila with grapefruit and Angostura bitters.

    "description": "The Cosmpolitan Cocktail (or Cosmo as it's commonly known) is a relatively simple drink with a big reputation. It was the drink of choice on the hit HBO show \"Sex and the City,\" where it was so frequently referenced by Carrie Bradshaw and her pals that the Cosmopolitan nearly had a persona of its own.Naturally, this pink-hued drink served in a Martini glass became a popular choice in the real world as well, and every night in America, countless bartenders made Cosmopolitans for hordes of thirsty patrons who enjoyed its sweet and tart taste.These days, the Cosmopolitan isn't quite as popular as it was during its heyday in the '90s and early 2000s, and it often gets a bad rap—unfairly, we think. The well-meaning Cosmo is often dismissed due to its color (hey, there's nothing wrong with pink drinks) or considered unsophisticated, but it's actually a classically-styled drink with a solid pedigree. The fact that it hit bar tops during the height of the over-the-top flavored Martini craze helped to popularize the drink, but you can't throw the Cosmo into the same category as the neon green, Apple Pucker-laced Appletini. What's in a Cosmopolitan Cocktail?Most modern versions of the Cosmopolitan recipe are made with citrus-flavored vodka, Cointreau, fresh-squeezed lime juice, and a splash of cranberry juice. You can dress up the glass with an orange twist or lemon twist garnish.Plenty of other Cosmopolitan recipe variations exist, ensuring there's something suitable for a multitude of preferences. The White Cosmo features St. Germain instead of Cointreau, plus white cranberry juice, while the French Cosmopolitan calls for Grand Marnier instead of Cointreau, and it adds a splash of grenadine to the mix. There's even the Cosmocello, a more obscure riff that uses limoncello instead of lemon juice. How to Make a Cosmopolitan CocktailThe Cosmo is easy to make. Add your vodka, Cointreau (or other orange liqueur—usually triple sec), fresh lime juice, and cranberry to a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until your ingredients are well-chilled, then strain the contents into a Martini glass, aka a cocktail glass, and apply your garnish. The drink should be pink, not red, so if you find the color a bit too dark, you may need to scale back on the cranberry juice.Who invented the Cosmo?Great question. Ask five people and you may get five different answers, but a few origin stories always rise to the top. A version of the drink that commonly featured cheap vodka and bottled lime juice was likely created in the 1980s, with reports pegging it to both coasts—San Francisco bartender John Caine helped to popularize it in his city, while Cheryl Cook made Cosmos in Miami. In 1988, Toby Cecchini at Odeon bar in New York got wind of the drink from friends in San Francisco, and he retooled it with better vodka and fresh juice. His recipe is the cocktail we know from Sex and the City and bar menus all over the world. Bar legend Dale DeGroff sometimes gets the nod for the drink's creation, too, but he's said on the record that he did not create it. He did, however, make plenty of them with good ingredients at his bar in New York, and he added the orange twist garnish.That said, the Cosmo is essentially just a cranberry-dosed Kamikaze. And a different but similar Cosmopolitan cocktail recipe appears as far back as 1934, featuring gin, Cointreau, lemon juice, and raspberry syrup. No matter. You don't need to know all the details to know that the Cosmo is a fun drink with a larger than life reputation.",

Here we've got the Truly Bitter, which mixes bittersweet Campari with Cointreau and Truly's Grapefruit & Pomelo flavor.

    "description": "Espita Mezcaleria is a Southern Mexican-inspired restaurant in Washington, DC. Thanks to Beverage Director Megan Barnes and the Espita team, it's also a fine place to drink mezcal, tequila, and other Mexican spirits like sotol, either straight or mixed into cocktails. Cocktails like the Strawberry Sotol Highball.It begins with a house-made strawberry-tarragon syrup, which you can recreate per the recipe below. From there, it's just a simple mix of sotol and lemon. Sotol's green, grassy flavor profile works nicely in drinks, pairing well with fruits and herbs—both things you'll find here.If you're in the neighborhood, stop into Espita Mezcaleria for a cocktail. Maybe even this one. Otherwise, you can try making it for yourself. The syrup, despite the overnight process, is actually quite simple. So provided you live in an area that gets the occasional bottle of sotol on store shelves (and you've got access to a soda siphon), you'll have everything you need.",

    "description": "The Mimosa is a popular brunch cocktail typically served in a Champagne flute. It is commonly found at events such as weddings, picnics, and other group gatherings, and you often see it being poured on Mother's Day, Christmas, New Year's Day and other special occasions. There's good reason for this: the Mimosa not only tastes good, but it's a low-proof option that's very easy to drink. What's in a Mimosa?The classic Mimosa recipe is very simple with only two ingredients: Champagne and orange juice.A decent dry Champagne will work well, and there's no need to break the bank for an expensive bottle, as any of the wine's more delicate or nuanced flavor notes will be lost in the juice. Cava, Prosecco or another dry sparkling wine will work fine as a substitute when you don't have a bottle of Champagne on hand.Similarly, different types of fruit juices are sometimes used instead of orange juice, such as grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, pineapple juice, pomegranate juice, and even peach puree. Of course, your choice in juice will affect the overall flavor of the cocktail, and it might even change the drink entirely: Prosecco and peach puree is a Bellini, while Champagne and cranberry (plus orange liqueur) is a Poinsettia.For the best Mimosas, we suggest going with a low-pulp or pulp-free orange juice to avoid an overly-thick texture, but do whatever you prefer. Also feel free to experiment with different combinations and your ratio of juices to discover your own favorite Mimosa variations. But the classic Mimosa is classic for a reason: It's simple, clean and refreshing.How to make a Mimosa cocktailThe Mimosa cocktail is very easy to make, which may speak to its popularity and regular appearances at group functions and \"self-serve\" beverage stations.Start by pouring several ounces of chilled Champagne into a Champagne flute, then top it off with a smaller dose of orange juice. Give it a quick stir if you like, but the heavier weight of the orange juice will help to blend everything together, and the bubbles will soon even out the rest.Champagne flutes work well because of the narrow mouth of the glass, which helps to preserve the carbonation of the Champagne. If you don't have any flutes on hand, white wine glasses work in a pinch. Pro tip: chill your glassware ahead of time.There's some debate among Mimosa \"experts\" about whether you should add the Champagne or the orange juice to the glass first. For whatever reason, it seems that adding the orange juice first results in some annoyingly persistent foam, even when using a pulp-free orange juice. On the other hand, adding the Champagne first can cause the glass to overflow with effervescence once you add the orange juice. Nevertheless, our inclination is to use the latter method anyway. Start with the bubbles, then pour the juice slowly and carefully—tilting the flute slightly will help to reduce the foam and froth. At this point, the Mimosa is ready to serve.Our preference here is to skip a garnish, because with such a narrow opening on the glass, there's not much room for something like an orange wedge or wheel. It will only act as an impediment to your drinking. A garnish that floats in the glass or sinks to the bottom will move around as you tip the glass to drink, and nobody wants Mimosa splashing on their face when opening gifts at a wedding shower.You can pre-batch your Mimosa cocktails in a large pitcher to help you serve a crowd quickly. But the drink is so easy to make—literally just pouring two liquids into glasses—that making a large batch ahead of time is usually unnecessary. Besides, the large opening of the pitcher will release more carbonation over time, and your Mimosas will be less bright, less bubbly, and less delicious.",

The 7 and 7 has a simple recipe with only two ingredients, from which it derives its name: Seagram's 7 Crown Whiskey (a blended whiskey with Canadian origins) and 7UP or another common lemon-lime soda. You don't have to use Seagram's, but this is the sort of simple drink that shouldn't require your best whiskey to come out to make it. Once an iconic order thanks to Seagram's advertising campaigns, its popularity peaked in the '70s and '80s (helped by appearances in films like Saturday Night Fever and Mean Streets) but has fallen sharply since. However, the current vogue for a throwback drink is surprisingly putting the 7 and 7 back into the cocktail vernacular of modern drinkers.

    "description": "Spiced & Pineapple is a simple drink combining just two ingredients: Bacardi Spiced Rum and pineapple juice. The refreshing cocktail is great for entertaining, especially when you don't want to spend all your time mixing up complicated drinks for your guests. Bacardi Spiced Rum is lightly aged in American oak and features notes of creamy vanilla, subtle honey, and charred wood, leading to a cinnamon and nutmeg finish. That spice works nicely with the sweet, juicy taste of pineapple.",

This easy vodka cocktail originated in Brussels, Belgium in 1949, and has been a perennial favorite ever since (its sister drink, the White Russian, achieved cult status in the late '90s thanks to the movie The Big Lebowski). You can adjust the ratio of vodka to Kahlúa to taste, though we generally recommend not overdoing it on the coffee liqueur, as it's easy to make this too sweet.What's particularly fun about the Black Russian cocktail is that it's a great vehicle for trying out new coffee liqueurs. It seems like every craft distiller in the world makes one these days (apparently they're relatively simple to make, compared to other liqueurs), and it's boring to just use Kahlúa all the time. Since the Black Russian only uses two ingredients, it allows the flavors to shine through without needing to sip the liqueur straight.",

    "description": "The Kamikaze Shot is a fun shooter version of the Kamikaze cocktail, which itself is structured similarly to a Vodka Gimlet (or perhaps a Margarita laced with vodka instead of tequila). It's made with vodka, triple sec and lime juice and has a soft, citrusy profile that acts as a crowd pleaser at bars around the world. The Kamikaze Shot rose in popularity during the 1970s as a party drink to knock back with friends. The alcohol content is lower than the cocktail version, so it's something you can drink a couple of without falling off your barstool. This ability to continue the good times may have contributed to its rise in popularity. And today, you're more likely to see the Kamikaze consumed in shot form than as a cocktail.What's in a Kamikaze Shot?The Kamikaze Shot is a simple drink, but that simplicity kept it from fully slipping into obnoxious nightclub shooter territory that befell so many of its contemporaries, despite its disco origins.The recipe for the Kamikaze has only three ingredients—vodka, triple sec (or other orange liqueur) and lime juice. Some recipes calls for Rose's Lime juice or other bottled lime cordial, but we always prefer to use fresh lime juice. It tastes better and tempers the drink's sweetness.How to make a Kamikaze ShotThe Kamikaze Shot is easy to make. Pour the three ingredients into a cocktail shaker half-filled with ice, and shake well. Strain into shot glasses, and serve chilled.Although it may sometimes be served with a lime wedge garnish, we don't see the need for this decoration—the shot is tasty enough and the alcohol kick tame enough to reduce the need for a chaser.When was the Kamikaze Shot Invented?According to noted cocktail historian David Wondrich, the Kamikaze shot was invented in 1976 and may have been the original \"shooter\" cocktail.Since then, it has stood the test of time, and it's still among the most popular vodka shots served in bars and clubs across the country.That said, it doesn't seem like there's much reason for the Kamikaze Shot to exist, considering the drink began as a cocktail with the same ingredients. This phenomenon didn't befall other popular cocktails like the Cosmopolitan (vodka, orange liqueur, lime juice and cranberry). So perhaps it's just a remnant of the prevailing trends in its heyday. We suggest trying the Kamikaze cocktail if you feel like a longer drink. That way, you get to sip it rather than knock it all back in one go, which is always nice. But, if you're going to make a shooter, the Kamikaze Shot is a good choice. It's the preferred shot of countless people, from college students to the after-work crowd, so you're in good company.",

And the drink itself is exactly what it sounds like: a simple, two-part cocktail comprised of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and Coca-Cola. It's a classic pairing that's refreshing and goes down easy, and it acts as a foray into whiskey for many young drinkers not yet accustomed to drinking spirits on their own.So while the Jack and Coke isn't a particularly nuanced cocktail, there's comfort in knowing that it's readily available at almost any bar across the United States—and, in many cases, the world.Oh, and here's a fun fact: in 2016, fans of the band Motorhead petitioned to have the Jack and Coke renamed \"The Lemmy,\" as it was the favorite drink of recently-departed frontman Ian Fraser \"Lemmy\" Kilmister. The initiative found some traction online, garnering more than 45,000 signatures, and it moved Food & Beverage Magazine to officially embrace the moniker.",

But toss in a capsule's worth of activated charcoal, and you get an extra spooky sour.Despite its sinister appearance, the Darke Daiquiri is an easy-drinking proposition. Used in small quantities, the charcoal is flavorless, so you're left tasting only the good stuff. And given its propensity for soaking up toxins, it might even help your hangover the next day.Note: activated charcoal can be a dicey proposition for some drinkers. It absorbs toxins, but also drugs—even prescription ones. So if you're on a prescription medication, it's wise to wait a couple hours after drinking activated charcoal to take your medication. That said, we're no doctors, so please do your own research.",

Gin is a noble foundation for the Negroni, but swap it out for bourbon, rum, tequila, or mezcal... and you've still got yourself a fine cocktail.This Mezcal Negroni from Vermont's The Copper Grouse proves that point nicely. The mezcal provides a smoky twist on the original cocktail, and its earthy undertones play nicely with the bracing Campari and rich, herbal vermouth.And with just three ingredients, all mixed in equal proportions, the Mezcal Negroni is an easy drink to make at home.",

A simple combination of vodka, coffee liqueur (like Kahlua), and cold-brew espresso, this cocktail packs as much of a caffeine kick as it does a boozy one. The Espresso Martini is a versatile drink that can be served with brunch, after dinner, or to fuel a night out.While it's likely that many versions of the Espresso Martini have been served over the decades, the drink's origin story is most closely associated with London bartender Dick Bradsell. As the story goes, he first concocted the drink in the 1980s for a young women who asked for something to \"Wake me up, and then f**k me up.\" The drink he created is certainly capable of both, and the Espresso Martini's popularity lives on, making it one of the most successful modern classic cocktails available today.",

It's a Manhattan variation that skips the sweet vermouth and instead calls for rye whiskey, Fernet-Branca, simple syrup, and bitters. The Fernet adds some bitter, piney notes to drink and results in a complex flavor profile.Given the name, Canadian rye is a solid choice, but American rye whiskeys also work great in the Toronto cocktail, as the spice plays nicely with the Fernet. Follow the below recipe to mix up a Toronto for yourself.",

    "name": "Long Island Iced Tea",
    "description": "The Long Island Iced Tea cocktail is one of the most popular alcoholic drinks of the '70s and '80s, and it remains a popular order today—so many of us have a story about the crazy nights that started with a strong LIIT. It's rumored to have been invented on New York's Long Island during Prohibition and named because it resembles a large glass of iced tea.This is not a fancy cocktail by any means, but the Long Island (as it's commonly called) gets the job done, and depending on which ingredients you use it can actually be quite tasty.What alcohol is in a Long Island Iced Tea recipe?The Long Island Iced Tea is typically made with five types of liquors. That includes four full-proof spirits—vodka, gin, white rum (or light rum) and tequila—plus a triple sec or other orange liqueur.We suggest making a Long Island Iced Tea with middle-shelf booze, as mixing all of the different types of spirits together will muddle up any delicate flavors and nuances of your more expensive top-shelf bottles.How to make a Long Island Iced TeaBuild the Long Island Iced Tea directly in a collins glass or a highball glass. Pour your favorite brands of the above-mentioned spirits into the glass over ice with fresh lemon juice and homemade simple syrup. (For the best results, always opt for fresh citrus juice and steer clear of any store-bought sour mix.) Top it off with cola and give everything a little stir, then garnish the drink with a lemon wedge or an orange slice.There's really no need to shake the ingredients in a cocktail shaker, unless you are looking for some additional dilution. If you do choose to shake, just make sure to strain the contents over fresh ice, rather than dumping the whole drink into the glass straight from the shaker.Contrary to what you may find in some recipes elsewhere, we do not recommend substituting cranberry juice for the cola, as the flavor profile is completely different and you lose the bubbly brightness of the carbonated soda. Coke is the way to go here, as it gives you that trademark LIIT flavor you know and love (or hazily remember from your youth).Variations of the Long Island Iced TeaA popular variation of the Long Island Iced Tea recipe is the AMF drink (or the Adios Motherfucker, as the cocktail is delightfully known), which swaps two ingredients—blue curaçao instead of triple sec, and lemon-lime soda instead of cola—to create an electric blue version of this cocktail.As you take a sip of the Adios (as it's commonly called in more conservative circles), you'll notice that the taste is quite similar to the classic Long Island.",

It's fruity, sweet, and not particularly sophisticated, but the Sex on the Beach cocktail certainly has its place as a fun drink for those nights you don't want to take yourself too seriously.You can elevate your Sex on the Beach (ha!) a bit by using fresh-squeezed orange juice, which always makes for a nicer drink no matter the recipe. But aside from that, there's not a whole lot of room for improvement to the Sex on the Beach recipe—unless you're going to buy some kind of expensive vodka or peach schnapps, which honestly would be put to better use in something that doesn't bury them under a bunch of fruit juice.If you're interested in something more along the lines of a craft cocktail while keeping with a racy and provocative name—then give the Pornstar Martini a gander—it'll certainly be a bit more complicated, a bit more elaborate, and a whole lot tastier.",

This drink was perhaps the first Manhattan variation that took its name from a Brooklyn neighborhood, creating a trend that has since given us cocktails like the Bensonhurst and Greenpoint.The Red Hook begins with a rye whiskey base. From there, it benefits from the addition of Punt e Mes, a mildly-bitter Italian vermouth, as well as some bittersweet maraschino liqueur. All together, it's a stout, well-balanced cocktail that manages to marry three strong flavors into a well-balanced, complementary package.",

    "description": "Hair of the Dog is a shortened version of \"hair of the dog that bit you,\" which refers to an old belief that if you're hungover from drinking, you should have more alcohol to feel better. Does it work? That's debatable. But what's certain is there are dozens of hangover \"cures\" out there, from cocktails like the Bloody Mary (vodka and tomato juice), Mimosa (Champagne and orange juice) and Irish Coffee (whiskey, coffee and cream) to the aptly named Corpse Reviver No. 2, a classic gin drink that's laced with absinthe.Some people even go so far as to down a shot of hot sauce and lime or lemon juice, which we can't responsibly recommend. But this simple, three-ingredient drink takes the name of its entire category, so we're inclined to trust it. Well, as far as anecdotal hangover remedies go.The Hair of the Dog cocktail is meant to cure what ails you, assuming what ails you is a hangover. You know the feeling: pounding headache, stomach is mad at you, mouth is parched.With just three ingredients—whiskey, honey, and cream—the Hair of the Dog cocktail is a tasty and easy-drinking option for a morning pick-me-up. Pair it with a hearty breakfast, and you'll rise from the dead in no time.To make this possible hangover cure, pour blended scotch, honey syrup and cream into a cocktail shaker, and shake with ice. Strain it into your glass, no garnish necessary, and drink up. It's not exactly vitamins or Pedialyte, but this booze potion may do the trick and end your misery after a long night of drinking. If not, hey, at least you get to drink something tasty to start your morning.",

Most recipes call for the Buttery Nipple shot to be served layered, with the Irish cream floated on top of the schnapps. In this case, it's helpful to slowly pour the Irish cream over the back of a barspoon, which will help to create that layered effect.If that sounds like too much effort, no worries—the drink may also be served mixed, especially if several are being made simultaneously. And given the shot's sweet and creamy character (it tastes a bit like butterscotch candy) the Buttery Nipple is a popular party shot. So it's rare to just make one.If you like this shot, you can also try the Slippery Nipple. It's another two-ingredient shooter featuring Irish cream, but it skips the butterscotch schnapps and instead calls for Sambuca, an Italian anise-flavored liqueur.",

    "description": "The Mark Twain cocktail, unlike a lot of other drinks named for famous people, can actually be traced to a letter he wrote to his wife in 1874 while visiting London:\"Livy my darling, I want you to be sure and remember to have, in the bathroom when I arrive, a bottle of Scotch Whiskey, a lemon, some crushed sugar, and a bottle of Angostura bitters. Ever since I have been in London I have taken in a wine glass what is called a cock-tail (made with those ingredients) before breakfast, before dinner, and just before going to bed.\"He likely didn't invent the recipe (since it's basically just a Whiskey Sour made with scotch and bitters), but apparently it was one of his favorites—especially considering he seemed to enjoy it at all hours of the day. Be sure to use fresh lemon juice, and don't bother using a fancy scotch, since it'll be buried among the other ingredients.",

It swaps the maraschino liqueur for Cointreau, and uses lime juice instead of lemon (Regan's explanation? \"I had no lemons\").The crème de violette remains the same in The Moonlight Cocktail, and your best bet is probably going to be Rothman and Winter if you live in the States. It's one of the few that's available, but the market is growing, so you might have more options if you find a good liquor store. The floral notes of the crème de violette complement the orange and citrus notes of the Cointreau quite well, and makes for a well-balanced cocktail. If you enjoy a good Aviation, give The Moonlight Cocktail a go—chances are you'll be quite pleased.",

The result is a festive, spiced, and surprisingly refreshing drink that's eager to join your winter parties and be consumed near fireplaces.The below recipe is easy to follow and uses ingredients that are readily available. To make that cinnamon syrup, just steep cinnamon sticks in hot simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water combined on the stove), strain them out, and let the syrup cool. Make a bunch, and you'll have enough cinnamon syrup to mix up Harvest Sours all winter long.",

That said, you're free to experiment—it's your drink, after all! Let us know in the comments if you come across a particularly delicious combination.",

    "description": "Many traditional eggnog recipes feature brandy or rum (or both), but this versatile cocktail can also be made with whiskey. And you don't even need a blender to make it. Instead, simply shake whiskey with milk, egg, powdered sugar, and ice to create a rich and delicious Whiskey Eggnog in mere minutes, as opposed to the laborious process required by some recipes.When choosing your whiskey, you can opt for the oak-accented flavor of bourbon, which sports notes of vanilla and baking spices. You can use rye, which yields a spicer drink than bourbon. You can opt for easygoing blended scotches, with notes of honey and heather. You can even go the Canadian route, and choose from a wide variety of Canadian whiskies for your base spirit. The key is just to pick something you like because the whiskey here is meant to be highlighted, not covered up.The Whiskey Eggnog is a fan favorite during the holidays, so make a few glasses to enjoy around the fire. When you do, be sure to give that shaker a vigorous shake. Doing so will help the egg emulsify into the liquid ingredients, and it will give the drink the rich and creamy texture you want. Garnish each glass with some freshly grated nutmeg or a cinnamon stick for a festive dose of holiday aromas.",

    "description": "The Pimm's Cup cocktail is a British classic that's great for summer afternoons and brunches with friends. The Pimm's Cup is fresh and delicious, with plenty of citrus, spices and herbal notes. As it's light on alcohol compared to a full-proof cocktail, the Pimm's Cup is easy to drink and there's little guilt when ordering a second round.What's in a Pimm's Cup Cockail?The base spirit for the Pimm's Cup is Pimm's No. 1, a low-proof gin-based liqueur that was invented in Britain in the 1840s by James Pimm, the proprietor of a London-based oyster bar. The name is derived from a tankard he used to serve the beverages from that he called the \"No. 1 Cup.\" As the drink rose in popularity, it began to be produced on a larger scale and was eventually sold commercially in various markets, including in America (the Pimm's brand is now owned by Diageo).The classic recipe for the Pimm's Cup includes a slice of cucumber, a slice of orange, and a strawberry and is topped off by fresh carbonated lemonade with a lemon twist garnish. Some recipes suggest the use of lemon-lime soda or ginger ale as a substitute for the fresh lemonade. This method works, but for most people it means using store-bought products. Whenever possible, we recommend using fresh juice in cocktails for the best flavors—and besides, it's easy enough to make your own carbonated lemonade with some fresh-squeezed lemon juice, soda water, and a little simple syrup.Experimentation is encouraged for additional recipe variations, as similarly to the Bloody Mary Cocktail, you can add nearly any fresh fruit and vegetable garnishes you want to make the Pimm's Cup your own. Some people even add a little gin or vodka to the recipe to boost its potency, but we're happy sipping this cooling refreshment as-is.The Revival of the Pimm's CupSince the early 2000s, the Pimm's Cup cocktail (as well as the Pimm's brand of products) has experienced a resurgence in popularity, thanks in part to the craft cocktail renaissance.The Pimm's Cup remains popular in England, and is an official drink of Wimbledon (along with champagne). Every year, the venue serves more than 80,000 Pimm's Cups to spectators, and the drink is also a standard cocktail at British and American polo matches. Then again, sometimes you'll find it in American cocktail bars and even dive bars, considering it's so easy to make. The Pimm's Cup may be associated with gentility and sports, but it's for everyone",

In this case: mezcal.The result is a gin-forward, tart, refreshing, and ginger-spiced drink with subtle mezcal smoke, which you can dial up or down depending on which bottle you reach for.Gin is often incorporated into summer cocktails, but with fall-friendly ginger and hearty mezcal, the Smoke Show can be sipped all year round—and actually makes a great companion to rich holiday meals.",

It precedes the more common Corpse Reviver #2, a wholly different drink featuring gin, lemon juice, orange liqueur (usually Cointreau), Lillet Blanc, and absinthe.

    "name": "Rum and Coke",
    "description": "The Rum and Coke is an incredibly simple drink (using just two self-explanatory ingredients), but it's a pretty delicious combination. Many rums (particularly dark rums or spiced rums) already have a cola-esque character to them, so the flavors are complimentary by nature. Note that if you add a lime, you've actually made a Cuba Libre instead of a standard Rum and Coke (the distinction is minor, but it's fun trivia if you're into that kind of thing).What's in a Rum and CokeRum, coke, and... well that's pretty much all she wrote. Naturally, you could get a little fancier and used Mexican Coke (which is still made with cane sugar) or maybe even a vanilla coke. And should you feel the urge to garnish, you won't have to get much fancier than a simple lime wedge. The history of the Rum and CokeWhile this Rum and Coke recipe has long been a go-to in nightclubs and other bars where you don't want anything complicated, it actually has a long history going back to the late 1800s. It was invented in the years following the Spanish-American War as the Cuba Libre (aka, \"free Cuba\") and started enjoying broad popularity during WWII. Because most American distilled spirits were rationed during the war, imported rum was often the only thing available, and Coca-Cola was one of the only companies with the resources to pay for heavily-rationed sugar. Ever since, the Rum and Coke has been a classic cocktail in the American and Caribbean pantheon.Popular rums for a Rum and CokeWhere this beyond simple cocktail can get interesting is through its alcohol element. Rum is a fascinatingly diverse spirit, and how a Rum and Coke tastes can be totally different depending on whether you opt for a Cuban-style light rum, a darkly sweet black strap rum, or even a funky Jamaican pot still rum.Spiced rums, like Captain Morgan, are also a popular choice for making a Rum and Coke, as these rums are already sweetened and contain a spice element that will introduce extra flavors to the drink. For something lighter, you can also consider Bacardi rum, which is widely available and inexpensively priced. How to Make a Rum and Coke cocktailTo make a Rum and Coke yourself, you'll just need to have your rum at hand and the cola ingredient. This is a cocktail where ratios can vary greatly based on personal preference, so whatever ounces of rum and ounces of coke ultimately go into the drink should be decided by the drinker themselves. That being said, 2 ounces of rum to 4-6 ounces of cola feels like a good rule of thumb.",

It utilizes a classic combination of gin, sweet vermouth, and bitters, and adds a bit of a twist with some maraschino liqueur. The first iteration of the Martinez is believed to have contained Old Tom gin, and using the sweeter style of gin still makes for a great cocktail today.While Martini drinkers may scoff at the use of sweet vermouth instead of dry, the Martinez recipe is actually much closer to the original Martini recipe than the modern Dry Martini, which utilizes dry vermouth (or, frequently and unfortunately, no vermouth at all).It's said to have been created at the Occidental Hotel by legendary 19th-century bartender Jerry Thomas, but like much of early drinking history the true facts are unclear. A recipe for the drink does, however, appear in the first edition of Jerry Thomas's Bar-tender's Guide.",

    "description": "The Whiskey Sour is a classic drink, certainly, but it's never been accused of being a pretentious one. Nor, thanks to its unassuming simplicity, has it ever held a seat at the table with some of its classic brethren, like the Martini or Manhattan. As cocktail historian David Wondrich once put it, the Whiskey Sour \"is the fried-egg sandwich of American mixology: simple, dull, reliable in a pinch.\" We're inclined to defend its reputation, however. Because while the Whiskey Sour might not be as complex in flavor as the Manhattan, it gets the job done. And, with a few easy tweaks, it does so in style. First, be sure to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice—no bottled stuff or sour mix. Additionally, if you want a little more texture and froth, you can add an egg white to the mix. If you do, just be sure to give it a good, long shake without ice—known as a dry-shake—first. Then shake again with ice to chill and dilute.The Whiskey Sour cocktail can be served up or on the rocks, depending on the drinker's preference, and the type of whiskey doesn't matter too much (though American whiskey, like bourbon or rye, is pretty standard). Either way, give this cocktail some attention, and it will treat you right for years to come.",

    "description": "The Martini is a timeless classic cocktail, traditionally consisting of gin and dry vermouth, and commonly garnished with olives or a lemon twist. Since its introduction, the Martini has become one of the best known and most recognizable cocktails of all time.Such is the Martini's popularity that the cocktail's name is used to reference the glassware it's served in—the Martini glass, aka the cocktail glass.James Bond, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ernest Hemingway, and other fictional and historical greats have been known to enjoy the Martini, and it has been associated with high society and good living for over a century.The history of the Martini is an interesting one, rife with fascinating as well as controversial accounts of the origin of this iconic cocktail. It's worth diving into if you're a diehard Martini fan.What's in a Martini?The classic Martini recipe consists of dry gin, dry vermouth, and an olive or lemon peel garnish. Some recipes also call for orange bitters, which add a subtle note of bright citrus to the mix.For the best Martinis, it's important to use high-quality gin and vermouth. It's less important to identify a \"best gin\" or \"best vermouth,\" as today there are lots of quality options in each category, and many bottles can make a delicious Martini with subtle flavor nuances.As with many classic recipes, creative bartenders have left their respective marks on the drink. Traditionally a gin-based cocktail, the Martini has over the years been commonly made with vodka or other spirits, as well as different types of vermouths. Experimentation with the ratio of gin to vermouth—as well as the use of alternative ingredients such as olive brine—has spawned a slew of Martini variations, many that are classics in their own right.The Dirty Martini adds a splash of olive juice to the traditional recipe.The Dry Martini uses more gin and less vermouth.The 50/50 Martini uses equal parts gin and dry vermouth.The Perfect Martini combines gin with equal parts dry and sweet vermouth.The Vodka Martini swaps gin for vodka.The Vesper Martini, made famous by James Bond in Ian Fleming's novel Casino Royale, includes both gin and vodka and swaps out vermouth for Lillet Blanc, a French aperitif.These are just several of the many Martini variations you will find with a little digging—many of them great, but some not so great. The '80s and '90s were rife with \"Martinis\" sporting all manner of fruit juices and syrups. The only thing these drinks had in common with the real thing was the 'tini suffix amended to the end of the name.How to make a Martini cocktail?Despite the popular but misplaced movie catchphrase \"shaken, not stirred,\" the Martini is a stirred drink that is served up.The classic Martini cocktail is very easy to make. Just pour your ingredients into a mixing glass (not a shaker), and stir with plenty of ice until the drink is very cold. Then strain the contents into a chilled cocktail glass, garnish, and serve.",

    "description": "The Brooklyn cocktail finds a good balance between the sweetness of maraschino liqueur and a nice dry vermouth (instead of the sweet vermouth used in a Manhattan), making it a delicious twist on the original. And just like its namesake, this cocktail is a little bit weirder than its neighboring borough, using a relatively obscure French bitter called Amer Picon. If you can't find any, though, feel free to use a more popular amaro like Ramazotti, or just a few extra dashes of Angostura bitters.The Brooklyn cocktail is one of a loose family of New York-named drinks, including the Manhattan and the Bronx. Though its origins are unclear, it can most likely be traced back to the years before Prohibition. While the Brooklyn fell out of popularity in the '20s and '30s, it has come back into style in recent years thanks to growing interest in pre-Prohibition cocktails.",

    "description": "The Mai Tai is an essential tiki cocktail that any beach bum worth their salt needs to know. Don't be fooled by any neon-colored pretenders or bottled mixes—this is a classic drink that doesn't need to show off. It's simple, delicious, and highlights the almond notes of a good orgeat alongside a timeless blend of rum, orange liqueur, and lime.The Mai Tai's ingredients are rum, lime juice, orange curaçao (or triple sec in a pinch), orgeat syrup, and rock candy syrup.So, to make a classic Mai Tai, you first need to make two syrups. Orgeat is an almond syrup that's used in a number of tropical drinks, and rock candy syrup is just simple syrup made with a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water (some people call this \"rich simple syrup\"—just know that, in both cases, you're using more sugar than water.) When choosing your rum, there's some debate over whether to use white rum, dark rum, or a blend of rums. Dark rum is a classic pick, but you can also start the drink with light rum and then float some dark rum over the top of the finished cocktail, if you like.Otherwise, be sure to use fresh lime juice and a high-quality orange liqueur. Grand Marnier is the most widely-available orange curaçao on the market, but you can find a handful of others. Some recipes call for extras like pineapple juice or orange juice, but we suggest skipping both. These juices were never in the original Mai Tai recipe, and they'll leave you with an overly sweet drink and a less balanced flavor.To make the drink, shake your ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice, and strain over fresh ice—many people choose to serve the drink on crushed ice. Garnish with a fresh mint sprig.Who Invented the Mai Tai?Good question. There's some debate surrounding the cocktail's origin. Victor “Trader Vic” Bergeron is often credited with first making the drink at his Oakland, California, bar Trader Vic’s in the 1940s. But another enterprising barkeep named Donn Beach also has some claim to the recipe, and it's believed that he served a similar drink a decade prior at his bar, Don the Beachcomber. Either way, the cocktail stuck, and the Mai Tai is still served all over the world today.",

Plus, it's fairly low in ABV (though there is most of a glass of wine in there, so not that low), so it's great for midday barbecues or beachside get-togethers.",

    "name": "Bloody Mary",
    "description": "Like a good casserole, stir fry, or smoothie, the beauty of the Bloody Mary is that it can be tweaked and adjusted to please just about any palate. Those who like them spicy can add a few extra dashes of Tabasco, veggie lovers can stuff theirs full of celery, carrots, and pickles, and epicureans can play around with a whole host of spices, sauces, and other tinctures to create their own signature flavors.While it's a versatile drink, though, it's important not to get too carried away. We can't count the number of times we've gone out to brunch with high expectations for this classic hangover cure, only to have them dashed against a drink so overwrought that it was more food than beverage. So take it easy, start with the basics, and try to limit yourself to only messing with one ingredient at a time.VodkaUnlike a lot of our favorite cocktails, the vodka you use in a Bloody Mary isn't particularly important. It's so heavily concealed under the tomato juice, spices, and sauces that you don't want to waste any of that fancy Stoli Elit or Crystal Head, unless all you've got in the house is top-shelf stuff.That's not to say we recommend just getting the cheapest spirit you can, because a truly awful vodka really can ruin a Bloody Mary. A standard Stolichnaya, Svedka, or Smirnoff will work just fine—luckily, vodka is a pretty inexpensive category all around, so it's easy to find a decent bottle for less than $20.Tomato JuiceTomato juice, on the other hand, is the Bloody Mary's heart and soul. No matter how many spices or spirits you mix with it, cheaping out on this stuff will make for a bad drink. R.W. Knudsen has gotten consistently good marks from various publications, as has Campbell's, and we tend to agree.Don't go nuts on fancy, heirloom brands, but stay away from anything remotely approaching a Bloody Mary mix. Like Margarita mix, it's cloying, unsubtle, and frankly, just plain gross.SpicesSpices and sauces are what make the Bloody Mary interesting, but it's important not to overdo them. There's no \"right way\" to balance the flavors, but a nice, basic combination goes as follows:To start, rim your glass with a lime and some celery salt. Into the shaker with your vodka and tomato juice, add a dash or two each of lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce (for the vegetarians out there, make sure to get a vegan Worcestershire sauce, as the regular stuff is made with anchovies), Tabasco sauce, and a pinch of ground pepper.The drink you're left with is simple, straightforward, and serves as a good starting point from which you can launch your own flavor experiments.GarnishUnfortunately, the garnish is where so many brunch places go off the deep end. Like a culinary arms race, it seems like every restaurant is trying to one-up its competitors these days with everything from bacon, shrimp, one of every vegetable ever pickled by man, and even entire cheeseburgers crammed heavy-handedly on top of your drink.While many of them have gotten attention for their novel creativity, we can't help but think that a Bloody Mary deserves better than to be a vehicle for food.You don't have to be a purist, but start simple: a stick of celery, a lime wedge or wheel, an olive, or (one of our personal favorites) a pickled green bean all work great in just about any combination. From there, you can play around with your own favorites and find your sweet spot.Final ThoughtsLike so many other cocktails, the Bloody Mary's origins are hotly disputed by the various bars and bartenders who claim to have invented it some 90 years ago, but what's important is that the drink we're left with today is something truly unique.It's unlike just about any other recipe in terms of its complexity and savory profile, but it's surprisingly simple to make—all you need to do is dump your ingredients into a shaker with ice, shake, and strain into a Collins glass.Cocktail snobs might dismiss it as something of a lesser drink, lacking the subtlety of other classics, but we think the world of great booze shouldn't be limited to spirit-forward tipples. Sometimes, especially after a night of too much champagne and celebration, all you really want is something tasty to take the edge off. The Bloody Mary does that with aplomb.",

    "description": "The Pineapple Upside-Down Cake cocktail is a fun vodka-based shooter that, while not the most sophisticated drink in the world, is sweet, tasty, and a popular serve at parties and nightclubs. The Pineapple Upside-Down Cake shot is a layered shot, with bright-red grenadine at the bottom and pineapple juice on top to emulate the look of an actual pineapple upside-down cake. And all without having to bake anything or even turn on your oven.Some Pineapple Upside-Down Cake Shot recipes call for vanilla vodka (or other flavored vodka), which is also a totally acceptable option. This isn't a drink where you really need to worry about subtlety, so feel free to mess around with all kinds of different ingredients and variations. However, the traditional recipe includes just three simple ingredients: vodka, pineapple juice, and grenadine.Add the grenadine to a shot glass, then shake the vodka and pineapple juice with ice. Strain the contents of the shaker into the shot glass, slowly layering the liquid over the grenadine to create the two-tone effect. You may want to pour the shaken vodka and pineapple over the back of a spoon, which helps the liquid to layer softly on top of the grenadine without disrupting the visual.Note that some people choose to garnish their Pineapple Upside-Down Cake shots with a maraschino cherry. This adds another visual element, but we find that garnishing a shot usually just gets in the way of drinking it. If you love cherries, you may enjoy downing the shot and then eating the cherry as a chaser.",

The Malibu Bay Breeze is a little lighter in alcohol, considering the swap from vodka to a lower-proof rum, and has a subtle coconut flavor. If you can, opt for fresh pineapple juice and some good bottled cranberry juice rather than something loaded with sugar. If the bottle says \"contains 5% juice,\" put it back on the shelf and slowly back away. Fresh juice will turn this from a rather pedestrian drink that's cloyingly sweet to something tart and refreshing. The Malibu Bay Breeze isn't the craftiest of cocktails, but it's easy-drinking, easy to make, and pairs nicely with a beach chair. ",

    "description": "The Liquid Marijuana shot is, well, not exactly the most subtle cocktail in the world. From what we can gather, the intent of the \"liquid marijuana\" drink is to get you tipsy, but the most common Liquid Marijuana recipe calls for equal parts spiced rum, coconut rum (commonly Malibu), blue curaçao and Midori melon liqueur—typically lower-proof spirits—making this a relatively low-ABV shooter compared to other shots and despite its druggy name. In addition to its boozy ingredients, the cocktail also features a splash of pineapple juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup. Some recipes call for sour mix, and many bars use it, but the pre-mixed bottled stuff contains artificial flavors and colors, imparting a chemical note to the drink. So, we suggest taking the extra step and using fresh lemon juice and simple syrup. The Liquid Marijuana cocktail has a sweet and fruity flavor and a bright green color. Order one at craft cocktail bars and you're likely to get a raised eyebrow and a quizzical look from your bartender. That said, sometimes it's fun to have a party shot that doesn't take itself too seriously, and many bars around the country are happy to shake up a round for you and your friends.To make the Liquid Marijuana shot, add all your ingredients to a cocktail shaker and shake until well-chilled—this is definitely a drink that you want to consume ice-cold. Strain into a shot glass and knock it back. If you're making drinks for a crowd, simply scale up the recipe by multiplying the ingredients by however many servings you need.For the record, there is absolutely no actual cannabis or THC in this Liquid Marijuana drink. If real cannabis is what you're looking for, check out our guide to cannabis cocktails and learn how the real stuff works.",

    "description": "The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails in the world. It is simple to make and a delightfully refreshing drink. With a crisp, sweet, citrusy and minty flavor, the Mojito cocktail is a classic for a reason.From its humble origins in the sugarcane fields of Cuba, it went on to travel the world as a favorite of celebrities, dignitaries, and tourists alike. Now, it’s hard to imagine summertime anywhere without this popular drink.The Mojito was a favorite of Ernest Hemingway (though not as much as the Daiquiri), and is a great cocktail for sipping on the beach or at backyard barbecues.What is in a Mojito?The classic Mojito recipe is an old Cuban original, and the ingredients consist of white rum, mint, lime, sugar (or simple syrup), and sparkling water, like club soda.Start by adding fresh mint leaves to the bottom of a chilled highball glass. Some folks like to add a lime wedge here as well for an extra kick of citrus. If you are using granulated sugar as your sweetener, rather than simple syrup, you should add that now as well. In that case, go ahead and toss in the lime wedge because it helps to break down the sugar. Muddle the mint by pressing lightly with a cocktail muddler—no need to overdo it by crushing the mint leaves to bits, as that will release bitter compounds you don't want in your drink.Next, fill your glass halfway with ice, then add rum, lime juice, and simple syrup if you haven't already added sugar. Stir well to mix all of the ingredients until nice and chilled.Then fill the rest of the glass up with fresh ice, and top off with soda water. Give it another quick stir, garnish, and serve.The combination of rum, lime, mint, and sugar is so natural that it seems they were made for each other. Drink a Mojito on a hot day, and you'll surely agree.As with any celebrated cocktail recipe, bartenders can never leave the recipe alone. Over time, countless Mojito variations popped up as people tried to make the best Mojitos. Fruit-laced versions may include berries, pineapple, mango, peaches, strawberries, grapefruit and other fresh ingredients. And batched recipes resulting in a large pitcher of Mojitos ensure there's plenty to go around for every occasion, from happy hours to pool parties.Who invented the Mojito?As far a we can tell, there is no clear \"inventor\" of the Mojito. The storied history of the Mojito gives some indication that the drink's origin had something to do with Sir Francis Drake, the famed sea captain, navigator, and privateer known for his daring exploits during the Elizabethan era.In the nineteenth-century Caribbean, we find the first mention of Sir Drake's name associated with the drink that would ultimately become the Mojito—it appears as \"El Draquecito\" (now more commonly known as El Draque)—and was a popular nickname describing the simple combination of rum, sugar, lime, and mint.While there's no proof that Sir Francis Drake actually invented the cocktail or even drank one of these concoctions, it's reasonable to believe he may have enjoyed something very similar during his time in the islands. Cuban rum and other island spirits at this point were typically unaged with rough edges, so citrus and sugar were used to smooth things out. Since rum, limes and sugar were all abundant in the Caribbean, it seems plausible that drinkers would have thrown them together into a tasty drink that became the Mojito recipe we know and love today.Why is it called Mojito?The origins of the name Mojito are somewhat murky, and the name is believed by some to be derived from mojo, an African word meaning to cast a spell.Realistically, the name most likely comes from the family of Caribbean spices and marinades, or the word mojado, meaning “wet,” but that seems less interesting than casting spells, so let us have our fun.One thing's for sure—the word is recognized and understood across the world, and that makes the Mojito cocktail easy to order just about anywhere you go.",

Originally invented around 2002 by Douglas Ankrah of The Townhouse in London, it has since become a global hit.The Pornstar Martini consists of two parts: the cocktail itself, made with vodka, passion fruit purée, vanilla syrup, and fresh lime juice; and the shot of champagne or sparkling rosé, which is served on the side. It's certainly glamorous, but it does take quite a while to prepare the ingredients.While you can use standard vodka in the Pornstar Martini, it can also be fun to make some of your own vanilla-infused vodka by adding a fresh, sliced vanilla pod to a bottle and shaking it periodically for a week.Getting your hands on a passion fruit to garnish your Pornstar Martini may be a bit of a challenge—our best suggestion is to check the Asian grocery stores.",

A tried and true bottle like Crown Royal does the trick, and is a common pick among bartenders.Given the Water Moccasin's mix of ingredients, it works best as a chilled shot. But if you really like the flavor, you can always pour the drink over ice and sip it as a cocktail. See below for the recipe, and enjoy.",

    "description": "The Captain and Coke is a simple two-ingredient cocktail that's made with Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and Coca-Cola. A more specific version of the Rum and Coke, it's a popular call at bars and a great option for people who enjoy the spicy-sweet flavor of Captain Morgan. The rum blends seamlessly with the cola, creating a flavor combination that drinkers love.The Captain and Coke is typically served over ice, either in a short rocks glass or a taller Collins or highball glass—the latter two options are perfect for those who want a larger drink or one featuring a bit more soda.The next time you need an easy party drink or just something to enjoy at home, mix up a Captain and Coke with the below recipe.What's in a Captain and Coke?A Captain and Coke is about as straightforward as it gets. To make this cocktail, all you need is Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum and Coke (you can aways get fancy and used Mexican Coke, which is still made with real cane sugar).The history of the Captain and CokeLike its cousin the Rum and Coke, the Captain and Coke owes its existence to an earlier drink, the Cube Libre (aka, \"free Cuba\", a rallying cry from the conflict). A byproduct of the Spanish-American war that saw the latter nation's most famous export combined with Cuban rum, it went from Havana to the United States in the early 1900s and found widespread popularity as a simple, thirst quenching drink.While the Rum and Coke was typically made with Cuban-style light rum, the drink was adapted to various types of rum, including Captain Morgan's spiced product. How to Make a Captain and Coke The drink is as straightforward to make as it sounds. All you need at hand is some Captain Morgan (or another spiced rum) and Coke. The ratio of this popular drink is a matter of personal preference, so how many ounces of Coke or ounces of rum it may contain is ultimately up to the drinker—though we think that two ounces of rum and four to six ounces of Coke is generally a good rule of thumb. Popular Rums for a Captain and CokeThe name itself implies Captain Morgan would be the best rum for making this drink, but there's nothing to stop you from using a third party spiced rum like The Kraken. But if you go that route, maybe don't call it a Captain and Coke, lest you confuse the bartender or your friends.",

This is balanced out a bit by the inclusion of dry vermouth, which keeps the sweetness in check. Everyone has their favorite ratio (ours is below), so we recommend experimenting with proportions until you find the perfect balance for your tastes.

If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth a visit. If you're not, well, that's what recipes are for. Mix up one of these for the Kentucky Derby, or anytime you find yourself with a well-stocked home bar and a thirst for something different.",

Lemon and spices are always popular additions to this drink. You can also use tea instead of water for some additional flavor, so you've got options. But once you take a sip, the Hot Toddy should be both relaxing and invigorating, giving your body the delicious, boozy sustenance it needs to keep on going—whether you're fighting off a cold or just trying to stay warm on a cold winter's night.The below Hot Toddy recipe is a good one, but feel free to experiment to your heart's content.",

It's comprised of Mezcal Banhez, Giffard Pamplemousse Rose (a pink grapefruit liqueur), Marie Brizard Poivre a Sichuan (a Sichuan pepper liqueur), fresh lemon juice, and grapefruit bitters.Ehrmann's cocktail was chosen from a selection of mezcal-based cocktails in a blind judging by a panel of experts led by competition director Tony Abou-Ganim.If you can scare up those ingredients in your home bar, give it a whirl. The drink's certainly unique, but made with all commercially-available ingredients, it's doable.

It can be served up or as a shot, and the Washington Apple cocktail is a fun, if somewhat unsophisticated drink, and likely enjoyed its peak popularity in the 1990s nightclub scene.The ingredients in this Washington Apple drink don't allow a lot of room for \"classing up,\" as you probably don't want to waste your top-shelf stuff on a shooter, but you're welcome to give it a shot (ha!). Any Canadian whisky will do, but an American rye will also work, and you can use a nicer apple liqueur (or even an apple brandy) that doesn't have so much artificial sweetness.That said, the Washington Apple Shot might just be best the way it is—a party drink that doesn't try to be something it's not.",

So a Perfect Manhattan is the same deal: base spirit (in this case whiskey) plus sweet and dry vermouth.When making a Perfect Martini, you can choose your preferred style of gin, but you can't go wrong with a London-dry like Beefeater or Tanqueray. It will stand up nicely alongside the herbal vermouths. Similarly, use quality vermouths, like those from Dolin, Noilly Prat, Cocchi, Carpano, and others. And be sure to keep the bottles refrigerated after they're opened, as vermouth oxidizes and eventually goes bad after about a month.Your resolute at-home bartending will result in a delicious, balanced cocktail that works equally well as an aperitif or a relaxing after-dinner drink by the fire.",

    "description": "The Amaretto Sour is a bit of a guilty pleasure drink, but as renowned Portland, Oregon bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler (Clyde Common, Pépé le Moko) has proven, one that's not beyond saving. While the \"classic\" Amaretto Sour was simply made with two ounces of amaretto and a boatload of crappy sour mix, this modern version stands up as a pretty damn good cocktail.There are a few tricks to making your Amaretto Sour cocktail stand out from the crowd. First, as always, is the inclusion of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, and a bit of egg white for a nice, velvety texture. Then, because amaretto is pretty sweet on its own, you don't need to use very much simple syrup at all. But perhaps the most important modification to the Amaretto Sour recipe is the inclusion of cask-strength bourbon, which adds some much-needed kick and helps the amaretto stand up to the other ingredients.To watch Morgenthaler rant about the Amaretto Sour and make his own, check out this video from Small Screen Network.",

    "description": "The Amaretto Stone Sour—not to be confused with the Amaretto Sour—is a sweet and fruit-forward cocktail made with almond-flavored amaretto liqueur, simple syrup, fresh lemon juice, fresh orange juice, and a maraschino cherry as garnish. The addition of orange juice to this sour recipe is what differentiates the drink from the Amaretto Sour and gives it the \"stone\" prefix.The traditional recipe calls for sweet and sour mix, but as our preference is for using fresh ingredients, we've replaced the sour mix with the one-two punch of fresh lemon juice and simple syrup for this version of the Amaretto Stone Sour recipe. Combine your ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice, give everything a vigorous rattle, and you're ready to enjoy this fun drink.For a slightly different take with a very similar flavor profile, you can make your own sour mix by combining equal parts lime juice and lemon juice with simple syrup. Make a quantity to accommodate several rounds, and you'll have a batch ready to go for amaretto cocktails and other drinks. Or, if you don't feel like batching anything up, just add a half ounce of each juice to the cocktail rather than a full ounce of lemon.We can credit the inspiration for the Amaretto Stone Sour to bartender Tom Bullock, who first published the Stone Sour recipe in 1917's \"The Ideal Bartender.\" His drink contained Old Tom gin, so the amaretto version is a departure from the original, but it has become a great drink in its own right.",

    "description": "The Gin and Juice is a simple cocktail that has stood the test of time. The drink has enjoyed such immense popularity that it's been forever immortalized in the eponymous hit song \"Gin and Juice\" from rap icon Snoop Dogg.We recommend using a decent dry gin for your Gin and Juice, as that will simply taste better. Something bold and not too delicate, so it can hold its own when mixed with the juice. And no need to get too fancy—just stay away from the bottom shelf plastic bottles. Fortunately, there are plenty of amazing gins available these days at reasonable cost. So you can save a few bucks while \"sippin on Gin and Juice, laid back, with your mind on your money and your money on your mind.\"For the juice, OJ and grapefruit juice are both solid choices, and one of the more popular combos. But one of the best things about the Gin and Juice is that it's customizable to your tastes. So if you'd like to experiment with different juices, like cranberry juice, lemon juice, or lime juice, go for it. How to Make Gin and JuiceSnoop Dogg is too busy to be bothered with intricate cocktails that require lots of ingredients and garnishes. So don't worry about getting too fancy here. All you need to make the drink are gin, juice, a glass, and ice cubes. You will build the drink right in that glass, so there's no need to shake with ice, strain, muddle, or stir. See? Easy.This recipe calls for gin, orange juice, and grapefruit juice—fresh is always best if you don't mind scoring some real fruit. Some people like to add a little simple syrup to their drink, especially if they're using lemon juice or lime juice, which are more tart. But if you're using orange juice, you can probably exclude any additional sweetener. Others like to top it with soda water or tonic water. These are also perfectly fine ways to make a Gin and Juice. As you can tell, this recipe isn't too strict about the rules, so do what feels right and enjoy yourself. Just remember that, although the Gin and Juice tastes like a delicious punch, it's still packing plenty of alcohol",

    "description": "The Slippery Nipple is a cheeky shot that combines Irish cream, Sambuca, and grenadine. It's sweet and creamy, with an anise flavor provided by the Sambuca. The shot is made by layering the Irish Cream on top of the Sambuca, and sinking the grenadine to the bottom, which creates a fun visual.The Slippery Nipple is popular at college bars and often with younger crowds, but if you like the taste of Irish cream and licorice, you'll likely enjoy it. And despite its interesting layered look, it's actually very easy to make at home.Why Is It Called the Slippery Nipple?Good question. Although the name is unfortunate, it belongs to the 1980s, an era in which many shots and cocktails were given lascivious names. Consider the Sex on the Beach (vodka, peach schnapps, OJ, cranberry) and the Silk Panties (vodka, peach schnapps).In this case, the layered effect of the drink, with a skin tone on top and a red drop of grenadine on the bottom, is meant to resemble the shot's namesake. In recent years, some bartenders have tried to recast these sexed up cocktails with new names. So, if you'd prefer to call this shot something else, it is occasionally referred to as the Licorice Ball.For a tweak to the Slippery Nipple, you can sub butterscotch schnapps in place of the Sambuca, and you get the Buttery Nipple.",

Throw in a couple of bittersweet aperitifs—Gran Classico and Byrrh—and some chocolate bitters, and we've got ourselves a cocktail. The result is complex but exceedingly drinkable. You'll want to have one straight from the source, should you find yourself thirsty and in Vegas.

    "description": "A Pornstar Shooter is an easy-to-make mixed drink with just two ingredients. What it lacks in subtlety (the name is a little rough, as are the ingredients), it makes up for in simplicity and fun.Though this drink can be extended into a full cocktail by increasing the portions of Blue Curacao and raspberry liqueur, it's typically served in a shot glass and downed in one go. The drink is traditionally made with Sour Puss raspberry liqueur, the best selling liqueur brand in Canada. Sour Puss makes a variety of different expressions, including peach, watermelon, grape, and tangerine. So if you like the Pornstar Shooter, you can experiment by substituting other flavored liqueurs in for the raspberry. Of course, if you can't find this particular brand, you can also substitute whatever raspberry liqueur is available on shelves near you. The end result should be very similar.The next time you're in the mood for some fun party shots, follow the cocktail recipe below to learn how to make a Pornstar Shooter.(Note that this drink is not the same as the Porn Star Martini, which is made with vodka, passion fruit, lime, vanilla syrup, and sparkling wine.)",

Consisting of Stella Artois Cidre, gin, rosé, and elderflower liqueur, it's a bubbly, refreshing, easy-drinking cocktail for toasting to the royal couple. And because the duo's wedding cake is an elderflower-lemon number, you're really adhering to the theme.The drink itself is very easy to make, and can be concocted right in your glass. Just be sure that your Cidre and rosé are plenty cold before pouring.",

In reality, it's probably created a lot more hangovers than it's cured, considering most recipes include a full four ounces of rum (one of which is 151 proof).The classic Donn Beach Zombie recipe uses something known as \"Donn's Mix,\" which is basically just a blend of cinnamon simple syrup and grapefruit juice. To make it, heat 0.5 cup water, 0.5 cup sugar, and two crushed cinnamon sticks in a small saucepan. Once it has cooled completely, combine the syrup with 2 cups fresh grapefruit juice.The Zombie is a cocktail that should probably come with a warning label: we rarely recommend having more than one, and three is getting into alcohol poisoning territory. So, all joking aside, take it easy on this one.",

Hailing from the Andaz Scottsdale Resort & Spa, it's merging Ron Zacapa Rum with Fruity Pebbles, milk, peach schnapps, and simple syrup. It's an eye-catching cocktail that's perfectly acceptable to pair with breakfast. And while you can't go back to being a kid again, well, you can sort of drink like one.",

It blends the creamy hints of toffee and almond from the Disaronno with the warming cinnamon-whiskey notes of the Jack Daniel's. The simple drink is made in a 2:1 ratio and can be scaled up or down as needed. If you want a larger drink, try two ounces of Disaronno Velvet and one ounce of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire over ice. If you want to consume the Velvet Fire as a shot, just shake together smaller portions of each and strain the contents into a shot glass.Launched in 2020, Disaronno Velvet is 17% ABV and has a floral character of almonds alongside chocolate and vanilla, all while providing that trademark amaretto flavor you expect from Disaronno. Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Fire launched globally in 2016 and is one of the best-selling flavored whiskeys in the world. It combines the brand's flagship Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 Tennessee Whiskey with a proprietary cinnamon liqueur and is bottled at 35% ABV.To promote the cocktail, the two bottles are sold together nationwide as a Velvet Fire combo pack, or you can purchase them individually. Either way, the duo can be combined into this simple and tasty drink.",

    "description": "The Strawberry Daiquiri is perhaps the most popular variation of the Frozen Daiquiri (which itself is a riff on the classic Daiquiri), and when done right it can be a deliciously refreshing summertime treat and a crowd pleaser on a hot day.What's in a Strawberry Daiquiri?The ingredients for this Strawberry Daiquiri recipe starts off much like a basic Frozen Daiquiri, with white rum as the base alcohol, simple syrup as the sweetener, and fresh lime juice, which balances everything out. We then add fresh strawberries and ice cubes, throw it all in a blender, and blend until you have a nice smooth texture.There's no need to use artificial flavorings or pre-made strawberry mix. We cannot over-emphasize the importance of using fresh fruit and fresh juice for a superior flavor profile—it simply tastes better. Much, much better.After blending, pour the finished beverage into a Margarita glass. Yes, the glassware seems strange considering this drink is a Daiquiri, not a Margarita, but that's the way things go sometimes. If you want to switch things up, or don't have the requisite glassware on hand, a cocktail glass or coupe will also do nicely. Then all that's left to do is garnish your creation with an extra strawberry, and serve. Pro tip: For the best results, chill the glassware in your freezer ahead of time until the glass is nice and frosty.See our recipe card below for the list of simple ingredients and proportions. Or, try this slight variation.The Muddled Strawberry Daiquiri VariationWhile the frozen Strawberry Daiquiri is probably the most popular variety, you can also make a muddled Strawberry Daiquiri just as easily. You'll need a shaker and muddler, but you can skip the blender entirely.Start by adding the strawberries, lime juice, rum, and simple syrup to a cocktail shaker, then use your muddler to mash it all up. Fill the shaker halfway with ice and shake well until chilled, then strain into your chilled glassware.Both methods are delicious, so go ahead and try both to see which you prefer.",

The drink, along with its' iconic copper mug, catapulted to immense popularity and inspired numerous variations.Being that gin and ginger beer have a long history as favorites in the UK, it was only natural that they'd eventually end up together in a delicious riff—named quite appropriately as the Gin Gin Mule.",

It's a fine place to spend your next vacation, in part because it's located on Italy's Amalfi Coast, but also because they're mixing up some serious cocktails. In making those drinks, Bar Manager Ivan Stankovic pulls ingredients straight from the property's garden, so the herbs and fruits you'll be imbibing are as fresh as they can get. In this case, he's working with some verbena-infused gin. And you can, too, by following the recipe below.",

    "description": "The Silk Panties is a fun shot that combines vodka and peach schnapps. While today it's a relatively obscure drink that has been mostly relegated to college bars, it was named “Drink of the Year” by Bartender Magazine in 1986. Yes, it's from the '80s, the same decade that brought us a slew of other drinks with provocative names.The Silk Panties can be served as a shot or enjoyed more slowly as a cocktail. This recipe, when shaken with ice, makes enough for two shots. If you'd like to drink it as a cocktail, simply strain the contents into a cocktail glass and garnish with an optional peach slice.For a simple riff on this drink, add a dash of cranberry juice, and you get the Pink Silk Panties (also called the Woo Woo). This version is typically served up in a cocktail glass.",

    "description": "The Blue Hawaiian is a well-known cocktail that you'll find at swim-up bars and in tropical locales all over the world. But the version most often served today (white rum, pineapple juice, blue curaçao, cream of coconut) is a riff on the original Blue Hawaii recipe, which was created by bartender Harry Yee at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in 1957. Yeah, it's a little confusing.According to drinks author Cheryl Charming, Yee concocted the Blue Hawaii recipe when Bols asked him to make a cocktail with their blue curaçao, which was a new product at the time.The Blue Hawaii recipe seen here includes vodka, Puerto Rican rum, blue curaçao, pineapple, lemon juice, and simple syrup, and it skips the cream of coconut. Overall, it's a much different drink that is a bit boozier, less sweet and creamy, and more balanced from the addition of fresh lemon. So, the next time you want to whip up a tropical blue drink, try Harry Yee's original Blue Hawaii recipe on for size.",
