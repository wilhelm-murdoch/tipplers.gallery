In 1877, his sons took over after their father retired: they have gone on to become the largest family-owned spirit company in the world. Family has always been the secret ingredient in BACARDÍ’s heritage, just as it has been in my family’s restaurants. We moved to the United States to chase the ‘American dream’ when I was 3. Through thick and thin we stuck together and worked together. I recently had a baby boy and my father gave me this advice: ‘To love someone unconditionally, to provide and only want the best for them, to put their needs before yours is what fatherhood is about. This is why I have worked so hard for the past 28 years. This is what family is about.’”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3037447ff4.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Father’s Advice","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"197 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","15 ml Punt E Mes or other full-bodied vermouth","15 ml Vermouth amaro","15 ml Amontillado sherry","7.5 ml Crème de banane liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"fathers-advice","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3933/fathers-advice"}
