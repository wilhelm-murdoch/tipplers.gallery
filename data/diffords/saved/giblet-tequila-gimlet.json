As for the name, I originally used mezcal de pechuga as the second ingredient. ('Giblets' is a culinary term for the edible offal of a fowl (heart etc) and pechuga mezcals are distilled with a chicken or turkey breast in the still. 'Pechuga' is Spanish for poultry breast.)","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af304e6832d7.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Giblet (Tequila Gimlet)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"153 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Tequila blanco","10 ml Mezcal","10 ml Lime cordial (sweetened lime juice)","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","5 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"giblet-tequila-gimlet","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2592/giblet-tequila-gimlet"}
