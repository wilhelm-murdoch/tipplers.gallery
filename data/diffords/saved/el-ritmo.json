This cocktail seeks inspiration from the feeling and culture of Central and South America. With tropical notes of pineapple, coconut and lime, it pays homage to the Puerto Rican classic: Pi√±a Colada.\"\r\rWe say: Pineapple juice, lime and coconut cream give this Legacy entry a hint of tiki and somewhat mask the rum. Amaro is the curve ball that makes this drink stand out.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af302e46dc8a.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"El Ritmo","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"169 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Cynar or other carciofo amaro","30 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Cream of coconut (e.g. Coco Lopez, Re'al etc.)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into glass filled with crushed ice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"el-ritmo","standardDrinks":"1.7","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3923/el-ritmo"}
