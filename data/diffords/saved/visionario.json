These values helped him invent a new style of rum that is still enjoyed today. I dedicate this cocktail to those with passion and a free spirit, who want to make a difference and leave a lasting legacy - just as, I believe, Visionario too can leave a lasting mark and become a classic.\"\r\rWe say: If you like Negronis then you'll love this drink. Golden rum presents a rounder base than gin to build the layers of bitter and vermouth flavours upon with faint sweet chocolate notes bringing all into a balanced complexity. Perhaps serve on-the-rocks.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af31811978af.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Visionario","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"204 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","30 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","15 ml Martini Riserva Speciale Bitter","7.5 ml Chocolate (dark) sugar syrup"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"visionario","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3927/visionario"}
