To quote my grandmother’s favourite song, one of the songs that we listened to most at that time, that was the ‘Ora Senza Pari’, the ‘Unmatched Hour’.\r\r“I heard that song again many years later, while I was on holiday in Italy. It was sunset and I was sitting on a terrace overlooking the sea, next to a woman who I was beginning to consider really special. We were drinking an Americano and sharing a bowl of peanuts, passing the time before going to a dinner to which we had been invited.\r\r“The sky before us was turning every possible shade of red and when a cool breeze picked up, the moment reached perfection. It was right then that I heard those words again, the ‘Ora Senza Pari’: someone was playing that song in the square just below our terrace.\r\r“We leant over to watch and we saw that the town festival had just begun. A small orchestra was playing and some couples had already begun to dance: there were people of all ages, elderly ladies in their finest clothes, their husbands sitting around, people laughing and joking everywhere…\r\r“At that moment, I understood the meaning of the ‘Ora Senza Pari’ and I reflected that everyone should experience a feeling like that at least once in their life. After the trip ended, I tried to communicate the scents and flavours of that experience in a cocktail.
