In one of his travels he came across the cocoa tree and named it ‘Theobroma Cocoa,’ which means ‘food of the gods.’ Rum and chocolate – the essence of Theobroma - are two of the great things in life that friends enjoy together.”","glassWare":"Rocks glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/43/201830c6757b6b3de4aa7e3a2cb3da92304f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Theobroma","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"145 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Dry vermouth","12.5 ml White crème de cacao liqueur","1 Saline solution 4:1 (20g sea salt to 80g water)","3 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR first 4 ingredients with ice and strain into glass over a chunk of block ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Gentle dash with bitters to create a layer"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"theobroma","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4426/theobroma"}
