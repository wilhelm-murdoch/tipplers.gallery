(I skipped number 16 because the number 7 so befits a Tennessee whiskey-based cocktail). If using a 40% alc./vol. Tennessee whiskey (as opposed to a higher alc./vol. special bottling) then this recipe benefits from an extra splash (5ml (1/6oz) to 10ml (1/3oz). Tennessee whiskey adds an appealing sweet toasty note to this fruit cup.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af301a7725b4.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Tennessee Whiskey Fruit Cup (Difford's Cup No.17)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"212 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Tennessee whiskey","25 ml Orange Cura√ßao liqueur","25 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","50 ml Ginger ale","50 ml Cola (e.g. Coca Cola or Pepsi Cola)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"POUR all ingredients into glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Half fill glass with ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add a citrus slice and a couple of mint leaves from garnish before filling to brim with ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Finish with rest of garnish"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"tennessee-whiskey-fruit-cup-diffords-cup-no17","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4219/tennessee-whiskey-fruit-cup-diffords-cup-no17"}
