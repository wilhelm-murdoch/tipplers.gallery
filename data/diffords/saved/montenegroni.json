Recipes include equal parts to twice as much amaro as the other ingredients, to one-and-a-half parts gin to one part each of the other ingredients. Having tried them all (well, all I could find/come up with). I've settled on this 7:6:5 formula which is amaro-forward, yet with assertive gin notes and not being overly sweet or boozy. However, you may prefer this recipe from Montenegro:\r40 ml Amaro Montenegro\r20 ml Gin\r20 ml Rosso (sweet) Vermouth\r2 drops Aromatic bitters","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/07/5f17faeca76b0.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Monte Negroni","Montenegro Negroni"],"name":"MonteNegroni","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"191 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Gin","35 ml Amaro - Montenegro","25 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"montenegroni","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/5448/montenegroni"}
