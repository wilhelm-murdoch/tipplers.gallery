The cocktail in the photograph is made using my precious old bottle of Zucca Herboris Amaro Centerbe but as this is near impossible to obtain perhaps substitute with equal parts Centerba Esprit Potabile liqueur and Cynar (a blend not as dry and bitter as Herboris Amaro Centerbe). I double carbonate (WARNING â€“ can be dangerous!) my soda siphon to replicate the effect of the bar's seltzer gun.","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2022/02/61fbba4c09515.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Lavorato Secco","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"66 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Italian red bitter liqueur","30 ml Rabarbaro liqueur","20 ml Herboris Amaro Centerbe","75 ml Soda from siphon"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"POUR first 3 ingredients (all pre-chilled) into chilled glass (no ice) and top with chilled soda water dispensed from a soda gun/siphon"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"lavorato-secco","standardDrinks":"1.7","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/10325/lavorato-secco"}
