The first milk shop ever opened in Stockholm was at the very same spot my bar, Corner Club, is located today. The order \"a box of browned butter\" was the code name for one wanting to buy booze. The bottles were concealed in butter in small wooden boxes and carried to your home in the open without any questions from the police. I wanted to find something truly Nordic that could not only reflect my geographical region, but also the bar I work at. Björn Frantzén is world famous for his food \u0026 one of his signature ingredients is browned butter.\"\r\rWe say: Tastes great but I'm not sure how many people are going to make \"pineapple \u0026 browned butter syrup\".","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af31612690fa.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"The Milkman","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"100 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","25 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e*Special ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Pineapple \u0026 browned butter syrup"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"the-milkman","standardDrinks":"2.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3896/the-milkman"}
