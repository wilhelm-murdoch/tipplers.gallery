Whether or how much you add is a matter of personal taste.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/5/47/2018445bcd329b421a31fac2cf08bc2bd86c.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","The white lady"],"name":"White Lady Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"190 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 Lemon zest oils","45 ml Gin","22.5 ml Triple sec liqueur (40% alc./vol.)","22.5 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix) (optional)","10 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Spray oils from a coin-sized lemon zest twist into the shaker and discard"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add other ingredients, SHAKE with ice and strain back into shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"DRY SHAKE (without ice) and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"white-lady-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2091/white-lady-cocktail"}
