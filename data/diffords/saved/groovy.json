From the music in our headphones, the city meeting the sunrise, the bar crowded like a beehive or the strikes of ice in a shaker, every one of us is searching for our own unique and exciting beat. \r\rThe Bacardi family has always kept a finger on this pulse, catching the tempo of the generations, no matter how many times circumstances hit that groove. For more than 150 years they have proved that this rhythm, stemming from Cuba, cannot be oppressed.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2f2061656.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Groovy","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"148 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Añejo Cuatro","30 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","2 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Kaffir lime syrup (Bring 250 ml water with 500g of sugar to the boil, pour into a blender with 30g of kaffir lime leaves"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Beat well and strain through a coffee filter"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Chill before use"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":")"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"groovy","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4770/groovy"}
