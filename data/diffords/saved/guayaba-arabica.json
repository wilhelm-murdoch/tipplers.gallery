My family is from Israel and Guava juice was a staple in my house growing up. It also happens to be one of the most popular fruits in Cuba. I love the intercultural connection between two places on opposite sides of the world. This connection is what inspired me to use it in my drink. Pairing it with subtle earthy smoky flavors of another Cuban and Puerto Rican staple, coffee (with deep roots in Middle Eastern culture as well) and the bright herbal notes of cilantro highlights BACARDÍ's versatility, while creating a new refreshing flavor combination that is somewhat unexpected.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3065b7b47d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Guayaba Arabica","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"101 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","30 ml Guava juice","22.5 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","22.5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","5 Coriander / cilantro leaves","1 Salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Coffee scented simple syrup"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"guayaba-arabica","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4018/guayaba-arabica"}
