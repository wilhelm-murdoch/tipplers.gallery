However, as David A. Embury says in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, \"Two dashes of Angostura to each drink constitute a pleasing addition to this drink. Lime juice may be used in place of lemon, but, to most tastes, lemon combines more pleasingly with whisky than does lime. Scotch or Irish may be used in place of rye or bourbon, but the smoky taste of Scotch does not combine pleasingly with citrus juices.\"\r\rWhile I'm usually in full agreement with Embury, I vehemently disagree with his opinion regarding the pairing of peaty Scotch and citrus. And for evidence to back my argument, I call The Penicillin Cocktail.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af312728c7c6.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Scotch Whisky Sour"],"name":"Scotch Sour","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"192 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Blended Scotch whisky","25 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Strain back into shaker and DRY SHAKE (without ice)"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"scotch-sour","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2848/scotch-sour"}
