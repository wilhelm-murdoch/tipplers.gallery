Maybe if Bouteiller was still in the company, his son would have become the French Governor of Santiago, like Emillio Bacardí.”","glassWare":"Flute glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30466a4e61.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"French Governor","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"133 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Pear juice (freshly pressed)","5 ml Tarragon sugar syrup (2:1)","75 ml Brut champagne or sparkling wine"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first 4 ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with champagne"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"french-governor","standardDrinks":"1.7","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3984/french-governor"}
