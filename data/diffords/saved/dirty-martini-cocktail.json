This is traditionally the liquid from a jar of olives and if using this then you'll need between 5ml (1 barspoon) and 7.5ml (Â¼oz) of olive brine. (Beware jars of olives packed in oil as this produces a revolting emulsion). Instead, as indicated in this recipe, I prefer five generous dashes of The Bitter Truth's Olive Bitters.","glassWare":"Martini glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af301cc25362.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Dirty Martini Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"151 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["62.5 ml Gin","15 ml Dry vermouth","5 Olive bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"dirty-martini-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/650/dirty-martini-cocktail"}
