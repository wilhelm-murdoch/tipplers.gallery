This street in Edinburgh, which is world-renowned, is where many generations of industry greats have established themselves, enabling them to leave their mark within the industry.\r\r“The Queen Street Cocktail also represents three principals that I went through to become the bartender that I am today: education, collaboration and innovation. Following these principles allowed me to grow as a bartender and they can be applied across all aspects of this industry.”","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/47/20183934031a15831fd48bf2d848b4218bab.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Queen Street Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"204 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Martini Ambrato Riserva Speciale","20 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","20 ml Sugar syrup 'simple' (1 sugar to 1 water, 48°Brix)","3 Celery bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"queen-street-cocktail","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4430/queen-street-cocktail"}
