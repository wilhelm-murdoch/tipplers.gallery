When made with freshly squeezed orange juice and Galliano L'Autentico (rather than Galliano Vanilla) this cocktail is worthy of a renaissance.\r\rThis drink is traditionally made without the sugar syrup or bitters, but is  a better drink with them. Shaking (rather than stirring) the first 4 ingredients makes the drink too thin.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3068eafd91.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Harvey Wallbanger","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"125 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Vodka","67.5 ml Orange juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","2 Orange bitters","12.5 ml Galliano L'Autentico liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR first 4 ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"FLOAT Galliano on the surface"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"harvey-wallbanger","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/936/harvey-wallbanger"}
