The classic recipe is equal parts tequila, curaçao and dry vermouth, but I like to add a touch more mellowing vermouth and then kick it back up again with the merest splash of mezcal. This adaption was influenced by Jason E. Clapham, who recommended this cocktail to us with the addition of 5ml / 1 spoon of Wray \u0026 Nephew overproof rum to give \"a bump\" to original equal parts recipe.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2021/09/6144b0068be1d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Matador","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"169 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["25 ml Tequila reposado","25 ml Orange Curaçao liqueur","30 ml Dry vermouth","2.5 ml Mezcal"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"matador","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/9729/matador"}
