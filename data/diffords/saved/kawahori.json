We tried making this drink a few times, with homemade pomegranate syrup as well as commercially available grenadine. How generous the spoon of yukari also greatly affected the outcome. Some of the versions we made were great but the recipe is not fool proof, or the ingredients so easily available outside of Japan.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3089732078.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Kawahori","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"93 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","40 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Umeshu plum sake/ Japanese plum wine","2 Grenadine/pomegranate syrup (2:1)","10 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e*Special ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Yukari rice seasoning"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"kawahori","standardDrinks":"2.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3909/kawahori"}
