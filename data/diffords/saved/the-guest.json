Building a relationship with them allows me to learn what they like and introduce them to new flavour experiences that open the world of mixology to them. Soon they learn to appreciate different styles of drinks using sweet, sour, bitter, complex and robust ingredients, giving them the confidence to order what they like.  The Guest is named for them, and inspired by them. It takes the flavours preferred by my most regular guests and interprets these using my personality as a bartender.\"\r\rWe say: Vaguely reminiscent of a rum laced Black Forest gateau.","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af315cc8cf43.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"The Guest","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"121 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","7.5 ml Dark chocolate liqueur","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e*Special ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Ratafia Di Andorno, Rapa Giovanni (Liquore di ciliegie Bere)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"the-guest","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3906/the-guest"}
