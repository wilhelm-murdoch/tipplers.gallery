This makes for a very powerful drink. Hence, we hope Jones would approve of our tweaking his recipe and shaking to mix. The result still has some oomph, but with the extra dilution of shaking, is a tad more harmonious.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3044da042d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"French 95 (a French '75' with bourbon)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"163 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","3 Powdered sugar (ground in mortar and pestle) (or use 5ml of 2:1 sugar syrup per spoon)","45 ml Whiskey - Bourbon whiskey","75 ml Brut champagne or sparkling wine"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR powdered sugar with lemon juice in base of shaker until sugar dissolves"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add bourbon, SHAKE with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with champagne and lightly stir"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"french-95-a-french-75-with-bourbon","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4238/french-95-a-french-75-with-bourbon"}
