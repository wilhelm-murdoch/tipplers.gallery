Some use as much as 15ml lime but I view 10ml as the limit and 5ml ideal.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2022/01/61f2a517b1c30.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Churchill Manhattan"],"name":"Sir Winston","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"156 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Blended Scotch whisky","15 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","15 ml Triple sec liqueur (40% alc./vol.)","5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"sir-winston","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/10848/sir-winston"}
