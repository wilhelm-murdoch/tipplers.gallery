If served shaken, then a white head should cover the drink's surface, or it's not been shaken hard enough. The cocktail should then be consumed before the head fades.\r\rEither shaken or stirred, sweet vermouth/port predominates with bitter liqueur providing balance.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/8/45/2018be13bd30f7501b6d08bc09a432da6396.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Four Poster Red","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"100 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","30 ml Chamberyzette strawberry aperitif wine","30 ml Tawny port","30 ml Italian red bitter liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass (preferably over a chunk of block ice)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"four-poster-red","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4570/four-poster-red"}
