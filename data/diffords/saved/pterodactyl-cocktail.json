Pterodactyl is the name of a species of Pterosaur and so is very hard to come up with expectations on taste from the name!","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3105bde799.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Pterodactyl Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"158 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["40 ml Gin","25 ml Vermouth di Torino","15 ml Gentian liqueur (e.g. Suze, Salers etc)","2.5 ml Absinthe verte (green)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"THROW all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"pterodactyl-cocktail","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4308/pterodactyl-cocktail"}
