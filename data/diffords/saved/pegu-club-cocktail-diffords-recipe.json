Also, in keeping with the Gimlet, I like to use fresh lime juice to add fresh citrus zing alongside the 'cooked' notes of the cordial.\r\rThe other moving part of a Pegu Club is the orange curaçao liqueur. A dry 40 alc./vol. versus a very sweet 20-27% orange curaçao will impact the overall alcohol and sugar content very differently. I use a dry 40% curaçao so this dictates the need to balance with a smidgen of sugar syrup.\r\rStrike the perfect balance and a Pegu Club is citrusy, bracing, and refreshing with the gin base providing the backbone while rich zesty orange curaçao, accentuated by tart lime, drives the flavour.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2022/06/62b44af20d122.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Pegu Club Cocktail (Difford's recipe)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"153 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Gin","10 ml Orange Curaçao liqueur","5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Lime cordial (sweetened lime juice)","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix)","7.5 ml Chilled water","1 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","1 Orange bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"pegu-club-cocktail-diffords-recipe","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2728/pegu-club-cocktail-diffords-recipe"}
