I also prefer to abandon the original layering and stir all the ingredients together.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2016/10/09/20168f084a3a02e068eccbabbcd840dd945f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Princeton","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"168 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Old Tom gin","15 ml Tawny port","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix) (optional)","3 Orange bitters","10 ml Chilled water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"princeton","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1606/princeton"}
