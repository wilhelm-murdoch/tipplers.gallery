Because a true legacy is not only what you leave for the people, but also what you leave in them, every ingredient from the cocktail symbolises life secrets that other people taught me. \r\rThe goal of A Secret is to inspire people to share their life secrets to help others create their own legacy.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2c47969e0.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"A Secret","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"142 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","20 ml Galliano L'Autentico liqueur","10 ml Cinnamon sugar syrup","25 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Pumpkin puree"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"a-secret","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4760/a-secret"}
