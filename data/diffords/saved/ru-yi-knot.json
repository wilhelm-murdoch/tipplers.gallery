BACARDÍ Carta Blanca is the perfect base to blend all the ingredients together and bring out the unique flavour; I used homemade mint tea syrup, tomato juice, lemon juice and black pepper to represent the sweetness and bitterness of life. I hope everyone who tries this cocktail will not only be touched by its layered taste like a life story, but will also be blessed in the future.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af311a561174.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Ru-Yi Knot","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"102 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 1/2 Cucumber (fresh)","45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","30 ml Tomato juice","30 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"MUDDLE cucumber in base of shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add other ingredients, shake with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Homemade syrup with mint tea"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"ru-yi-knot","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4023/ru-yi-knot"}
