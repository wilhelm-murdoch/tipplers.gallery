Brilliant as an aperitif on a hot summer's evening.\r\rJim's original recipe calls for 7.5ml (¼oz) elderflower liqueur but in October 2020, due to popular demand (see comments below), I amended the above recipe to have twice the volume of elderflower liqueur. Then, in June 2022, also in the pursuit of balance and pleasing the tastes of as many as possible, I nudged this back to  10ml (1/3oz). Given variations in citrus, I believe this is my final amendment.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30db1718cb.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Old Friend","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"131 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Gin","22.5 ml Pink grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Italian red bitter liqueur","10 ml Elderflower liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"old-friend","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4258/old-friend"}
