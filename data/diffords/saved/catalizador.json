What most people believed to have started with a tax on tea actually began with discord created by a tax on rum in 1733.\r \r“The second inspiration for the Catalizador came from my grandmother’s natural remedy for my hyperthyroidism. She introduced me to camomile and its calming properties alleviated my condition.\r \r“So, rum and tea were the CATALYST for the war leading the Americans to their freedom, tea was the CATALYST in aiding a heart condition, and BACARDÍ was the CATALYST that inspired and continues to inspire bartenders to create a whole new genre of light, crisp, refreshing, and legacy-worthy cocktails.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2ff05e60e6.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Catalizador","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"215 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Bianco vermouth","35 ml Camomile tea syrup (2:1)","10 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain back into shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"DRY SHAKE (without ice) and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"catalizador","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4017/catalizador"}
