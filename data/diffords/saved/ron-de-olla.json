The orange twist breaks the sweetness and aromatics with a citrus taste, and the BACARDÍ Superior brings out the taste and flavour of the almonds and vanilla – creating a balanced flavour profile.”","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af31168a1cc4.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Ron de Olla","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"62 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","30 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","90 ml *Special ingredient #2 (see above)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Macerate spice mix and rum in base of shake"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add chocolate, SHAKE with ice and fine strain into ice filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Crown with crushed ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Spice mix"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"5mg cinnamon, 5mg ground coffee, almond, star anise, 5ml vanilla essence, clove and orange peel"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #2\u003c/strong\u003e: Chocolate solution"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Hot chocolate powder mixed with hot water and allowed to cool"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"ron-de-olla","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4014/ron-de-olla"}
