Mary is owner, bartender \u0026 host of the oldest family pub in Cork - The Castle Inn. The Castle has no television, Wi-Fi or phones; the only noise you can hear is chatting amongst friends. When you are served a cold drink by Mary it is the perfect welcome. I also grew up working in a family pub and understand the importance of tradition. My Hug from Mary cocktail reflects flavours found in any Irish bar, my bartending career, a salute to Irish bartenders and, of course, Mary!”","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/46/2018e9eb8963adacb3b761e8ccdfdbcd5473.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Hug From Mary","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"287 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","30 ml Stout beer","10 ml Coffee liqueur","10 ml Pedro Ximénez sherry","4 Xocolatl mole bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"THROW all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"hug-from-mary","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4415/hug-from-mary"}
