The name evokes BACARDÍ's Cuban heritage: Chan Chan is the iconic Cuban band Buena Vista Social Club’s most famous song. It conjures up the very feeling of Cuban music and salsa dance while encouraging a global appeal.\r \r‘Chan Chan’ is delicate and floral on the nose as the BACARDÍ Carta Blanca lifts the St-Germain. The MARTINI Dry dries out the cocktail and adds further complexity to the Peychaud's bitters and BACARDÍ on the palate. The drink finishes with perfectly balanced acidity, refreshing you for the next sip.\"","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2ff4bb6dcf.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Chan Chan","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"140 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Dry vermouth","10 ml Elderflower liqueur","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix)","3 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"chan-chan","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3987/chan-chan"}
