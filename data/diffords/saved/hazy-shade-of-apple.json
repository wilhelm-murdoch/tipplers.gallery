To perfect this combination, I infused the BACARDÍ with a cinnamon stick for 24 hours. A little fresh lime, apple juice and vanilla sugar rounds it up and the pink pepper on top gives the drink a great after-taste.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3069a0c99f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Hazy Shade Of Apple","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"207 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca (cinnamon infused)","15 ml Rosato/rosé vermouth","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","20 ml Apple juice (apple cider) unsweetened \u0026 cloudy","20 ml Vanilla sugar syrup","1 Pink peppercorns"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"hazy-shade-of-apple","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4033/hazy-shade-of-apple"}
