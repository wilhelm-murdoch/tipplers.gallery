Ritmo Tropical is something that comes from within me; it is the spirit of the Caribbean that speaks through a certain tropical rhythm that can fill your heart with happiness and make you proud to be alive. The sound of rum nourishes the soul and makes the feet move.\r\rThe mix of ingredients in my cocktail may seem unusual for a tropical cocktail, but each one of them represents an important part of Caribbean cocktail history – I hope that one day Ritmo Tropical will stand beside timeless BACARDÍ classics like the Mojito.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2baf67e89.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Ritmo Tropical","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"167 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Añejo Cuatro","15 ml Bianco vermouth","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","30 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)","3 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters","5 ml Absinthe verte (green)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first 5 ingredients with ice and fine strain into absinthe washed glass chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"ritmo-tropical","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4759/ritmo-tropical"}
