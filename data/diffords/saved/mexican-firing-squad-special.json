The bitters play a key role in both balance and flavour.\r\rIt's worth noting that this drink is a sour served in a highball glass but it is not a Highball and should not be topped with soda. A highball glass should be a max capacity of 10oz / 296ml. Use such a glass filled with ice and this recipe will fill to a good washline without need, or room, for a soda top.","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/01/5e34239d1bb9a.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Mexican Firing Squad Special","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"172 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Tequila reposado","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","12.5 ml Grenadine/pomegranate syrup (2:1)","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"mexican-firing-squad-special","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4945/mexican-firing-squad-special"}
