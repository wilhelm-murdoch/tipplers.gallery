This was also the year that BACARDÍ rum was born.\r\rBy revising this classic drink for a modern palette with BACARDÍ Reserve Ocho, my cocktail 1862 celebrates this happy coincidence.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f23611c752.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"1862 Flip","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"209 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","90 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","15 ml Vanilla sugar syrup","15 ml Espresso coffee (freshly made \u0026 hot)","5 Freshly grated nutmeg","22.5 ml Egg yolk"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Pineapple and banana juice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"1862-flip","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4738/1862-flip"}
