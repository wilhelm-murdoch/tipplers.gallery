However, in early 2020, I decided that the maraschino and violet were overly dominant so in a quest for harmony I reduced these to allow botanical gin notes to emerge. I then rebalanced with 5ml sugar:\r- 45 ml Dry gin\r- 12.5 ml Luxardo Maraschino liqueur\r- 5 ml Crème de violette\r- 15 ml Lemon juice\r- 5 ml Sugar syrup \r- 10 ml Chilled water (omit if wet ice)\rThanks to emails and comments below I came to my senses and reverted to my original recipe.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/5/38/20183936b9ab9087a6c934edd8bebceeae1d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Aviation Cocktail (Difford's recipe)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"173 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["52.5 ml Gin","15 ml Maraschino liqueur","7.5 ml Crème de violette liqueur","15 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","7.5 ml Chilled water (omit if wet ice)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"aviation-cocktail-diffords-recipe","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/127/aviation-cocktail-diffords-recipe"}
