He created one of the finest rums in the world, a rum that the Cubans regarded as a salvation from the harsh and fiery ‘ron’ previously available – a rum we know as BACARDÍ.\r\r“By offering a moment of tranquillity to the people of Cuba with each sip of his rum during difficult times, Don Facundo Bacardí Masso became the embodiment of the Sugar Man.\r\r“A man. A song. A drink. A legacy. Taste the Sugar Man.”","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3147974478.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Sugar Man","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"177 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Ginger syrup","3 Absinthe verte (green)","45 ml Ginger beer"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first 4 ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with ginger beer"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"sugar-man","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3938/sugar-man"}
