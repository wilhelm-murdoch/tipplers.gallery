This cocktail also pays tribute to Ernest Hemingway, by balancing aspects of the 'Hemingway Daiquiri' with cucumber, flowers and bitter lemon soda. The result is a refreshing drink, to be served day or night and enjoyed by men and women alike.”","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af306bb866fa.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Hermosa Despedida","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"217 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 Cucumber (fresh)","60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Maraschino liqueur","10 ml Violet sugar syrup","25 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","50 ml Bitter lemon tonic"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Fill half a glass with crushed ice and place slice of cucumber in glass before fully filling glass with more crushed ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE next 4 ingredients (all but bitter lemon soda) with ice strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with bitter lemon soda"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"hermosa-despedida","standardDrinks":"2.5","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4026/hermosa-despedida"}
