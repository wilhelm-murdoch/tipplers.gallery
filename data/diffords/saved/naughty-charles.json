So, back at my own bar, I experimented with reducing the sweet components. The conclusion, Liam (the drink's creator) nailed it the first time and the proportions he used are the best to make the five ingredients shine. It's not sweet, but it wavers on the sweet side of balanced, so I'd recommend enjoying after a meal.","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/01/5c41cc815d85a.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Naughty Charles","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"179 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Blended Scotch whisky","10 ml Cherry brandy liqueur","10 ml White cr√®me de cacao liqueur","15 ml Dry vermouth","2 Orange bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"naughty-charles","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4663/naughty-charles"}
