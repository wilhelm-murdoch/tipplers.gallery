In 1862 the wife of Facundo Bacardi was walking along a distilling factory and heard the sound of bats under the roof. So she suggested the bat as their logo, symbolising health, happiness and success. Thus the bat became one of the most recognizable logos in the world \r\r“This story inspired me to make a cocktail in honour of all women who give us inspiration and strength with their passion, beauty and love to do great things. And the wife was called Amalia; I named my cocktail in honour of her and of all women.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fb4d7f08f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Amalia (by Robert Kalvans)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"170 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Apple juice (apple cider) unsweetened \u0026 cloudy","20 ml Passion fruit syrup","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)","10 Basil leaves"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"amalia-by-robert-kalvans","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4011/amalia-by-robert-kalvans"}
