Cut lime in half (from pole to pole) and then slice one of the halves into eight 3-4mm thick half-moon shaped segments and drop into the base of a robust rocks glass.\r\r2. Add 3 bar spoons caster sugar (or ½oz / 15ml sugar syrup 2:1) and MUDDLE.\r\r3. Add blueberries and MUDDLE some more.\r\r4. When sure fruit juice is fully extracted and the sugar dissolved, transfer the muddled fruit and sugar into serving glass (preferably a 30cl / 10oz highball glass).\r\r5. POUR cachaça (stored in the freezer) into the rocks glass (used to muddle) and swirl to rinse glass before pouring cachaça into serving glass. STIR to ensure all ingredients are well mixed.\r\r6. Crack (rather than crush) four to five large ice cubes and drop into serving glass. STIR before topping with more ice and serve with a stirrer (but no straws).","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fdc002d18.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Blueberry Caipirinha","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"134 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1/2 Lime (fresh) (chopped)","3 White caster sugar","10 Blueberries (fresh)","60 ml Cachaça (from freezer)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Cut lime in half (from pole to pole) and then slice one of the halves into eight 3-4mm thick half-moon shaped segments and drop into the base of a robust rocks glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Add 3 bar spoons caster sugar (or ½oz / 15ml sugar syrup 2:1) and MUDDLE"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Add blueberries and MUDDLE some more"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e4"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e When sure fruit juice is fully extracted and the sugar dissolved, transfer the muddled fruit and sugar into serving glass (preferably a 30cl / 10oz highball glass)"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e5"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e POUR cachaça (stored in the freezer) into the rocks glass (used to muddle) and swirl to rinse glass before pouring cachaça into serving glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR to ensure all ingredients are well mixed"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e6"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Crack (rather than crush) four to five large ice cubes and drop into serving glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR before topping with more ice and serve with a stirrer (but no straws)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"blueberry-caipirinha","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4133/blueberry-caipirinha"}
