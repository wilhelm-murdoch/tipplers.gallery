I like the grainy bite the generous measure of vodka adds but it's a punchy drink, so I have cut the vodka back to 60ml and cut back the sugar to 5ml to maintain balance. The only downside to this revised recipe is that the washline may sit a little low in the glass.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3127f61904.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Screwdriver (Difford's recipe)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"160 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Vodka","90 ml Orange juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","3 Orange bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR (preferably with a screwdriver) all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"screwdriver-diffords-recipe","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1762/screwdriver-diffords-recipe"}
