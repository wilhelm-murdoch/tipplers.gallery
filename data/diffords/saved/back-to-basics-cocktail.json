I tried to capture memories and the people that affected me and made me who I am today - my friends, family and my partner in life. One of the things that really motivates me is the desire to take care of our planet. I put a lot of sustainable thinking into my cocktail, I believe we can all take care of our planet by maximising our products and extending their lifetime. My agenda is to help to create a better world and a greener future.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/45/2018477c363733ded7dbd26915315bd1298f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Back to Basics Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"141 calories"},"prepTime":"PT10M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml White (charcoal-filtered) 1-4 year old light rum","30 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","22.5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Dry vermouth","15 ml Aquafaba (chickpea water)","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Orange and red wine syrup - cube 1 orange, adding half the peel from a 2nd orange and soak in 300g sugar for up to 1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"5 hours"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Simmer with 330 ml red wine (Merlot) until the alcohol evaporates (around 10 mins)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"back-to-basics-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.5","totalTime":"PT10M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4416/back-to-basics-cocktail"}
