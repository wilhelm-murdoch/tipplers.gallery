However, arguably, shaking yields an even more delicious drink and, if you decide to shake, consider doubling the measures of both crème de violette and absinthe. Shaken, or stirred, this Martini-style cocktail is dry and aromatic with subtle floral and aniseed notes.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2021/07/60e5c2a7df80c.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"The Atty Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"158 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Gin","20 ml Dry vermouth","1.25 ml Crème de violette liqueur","1.25 ml Absinthe verte (green)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"the-atty-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.5","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/532/the-atty-cocktail"}
