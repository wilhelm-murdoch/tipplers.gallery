Spanish wine trader and founder of the brand, Don Facundo Bacardí, is represented as sherry. He learned how to distill spirits from the Frenchman Jose Leon Boutellier, symbolised by absinthe. \r\r“Facundo's aim was to create a spirit similar to brandy, popular amongst the wealthy in those times; Mandarin Napoleon is a reminder of this. The bitter sour taste of my mandarin reduction symbolises the hardships the Bacardí family endured, such as earthquakes, fire and exile from Cuba. White chocolate syrup represents the good sweet moments of success. The main ingredient, BACARDÍ rum, reflects the untameable spirit of the Bacardí family.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30ded022e1.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Orgullo","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"195 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Mandarine liqueur","10 ml Fino sherry","5 ml White chocolate sugar syrup","30 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","2 Absinthe verte (green)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Mandarin reduction with fresh lemon juice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"orgullo","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3995/orgullo"}
