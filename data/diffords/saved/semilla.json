To achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes; to someone who doesn't understand growth this would seem like complete destruction. But the seeds that you plant today, become the harvest that you'll reap tomorrow. And that will be your legacy.”","glassWare":"Double old-fashioned","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/37/201861a0217fab686ad0a175cfc2ce9b3e20.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Semilla","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"208 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","25 ml Martini Ambrato Riserva Speciale","7.5 ml Martini Riserva Speciale Bitter","5 ml Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur","4 Soy sauce"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"semilla","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4413/semilla"}
