This version not only has pineapple but traditionally 1 part dry vermouth and 1 part rosso vermouth to 2 parts gin. I prefer with a tad less dry vermouth.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/05/5ce7bbfc3acd6.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Queens","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"160 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Gin","22.5 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","15 ml Dry vermouth","30 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"queens","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1624/queens"}
