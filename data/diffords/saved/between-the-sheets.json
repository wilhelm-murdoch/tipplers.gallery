My recipe uses a more manageable 67.5ml (2¼oz) of liquor (25% less) whilst maintaining the classic proportions with just a smidgen less citrus (33% less). If you like a tart Between The Sheets then use a touch more lemon juice. [Forgive the pun!]\r\rA Between The Sheets isn't necessarily dry gin + rum + triple sec and of the three versions that span this cocktail's history:\rNo. 1. Dry gin + Light white rum + Triple sec + Lemon juice\rNo. 2. Brandy + Dry gin + Triple sec + Lemon juice\rNo. 3. Brandy + Light white rum + Triple sec + Lemon juice\rMy own preference is for No. 1, then No. 2, and lastly No. 3, the last being the combination of base spirits that have become standard for this cocktail.\r\rAs is so often the case, the original (No.1) is the best. To experience all three versions, maintain the three equal parts plus 5ml (1 barspoon) lemon juice proportions whilst switching base spirits.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2022/06/629e13a512a02.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Between The Sheets","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"150 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["22.5 ml White (charcoal-filtered) 1-4 year old light rum","22.5 ml Cognac (brandy)","22.5 ml Triple sec liqueur (40% alc./vol.)","5 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"between-the-sheets","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/209/between-the-sheets"}
