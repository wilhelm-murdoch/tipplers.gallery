I come from a small town in India, and have struggled, worked very hard and with passion, in spite of many odds. Today, as a head bartender in one of India’s largest hospitality groups – I am very proud of my journey and the tenacious character it has instilled in me!\r\r“I feel I have the ‘spirit of Santiago’ and I want to keep this spirit alive, and pass it on to every bartender around the world who makes this drink, and to every consumer who sips it. A salute to this spirit: ‘Espiritu De Santiago’.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30338ee038.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Espiritu de Santiago","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"209 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Chartreuse Yellow","15 ml Coconut sugar syrup","30 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","4 Sage leaves"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"espiritu-de-santiago","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3986/espiritu-de-santiago"}
