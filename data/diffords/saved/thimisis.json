Thimisis clearly has a Mediterranean character and its name is both the Greek word for memory and the first letters of thyme. The reason thyme is so important is that in Ancient Greece it was a symbol of durability and resistance, two things that completely represent the Bacardi family.\"\r\rWe say: It took us a while to find our bottle of  Bigallet Thyme liqueur but once we tried this drink we discovered it was worth searching out. This is basically a thyme and lavender daiquiri and it likes plenty of dilution. We found a floral honey worked best.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af316b6c8f64.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Thimisis","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"192 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Thyme liqueur","15 ml Honey water (1:1)","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","2 Lavender bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"thimisis","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3916/thimisis"}
