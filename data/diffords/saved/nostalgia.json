The bitter taste of medicine when we were sick, the taste of lollipops or our favourite fruits; these each evoke childhood memories and feelings from when they were first experienced.\r\r“For me, my strongest memories are the delicious tastes from food and drink that would eventually pave the career I have today. Nostalgia awakens beautiful memories and inspires my creative and positive actions today. Nostalgia reminds me of the joyful moments of my childhood.”","glassWare":"Rocks glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/41/201815690fea4e810494d8d6afc5396366b9.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Nostalgia","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"183 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Crème de banane liqueur","25 ml Coconut water","5 ml Orgeat (almond) sugar syrup","5 ml Fino sherry","5 Whisky - Peated Scotch whisky"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and fine strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"nostalgia","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4428/nostalgia"}
