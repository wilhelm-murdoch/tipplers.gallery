If using a 12oz glass (350ml to fill level) the ice displacement = approximately 140ml, so ice forms 40% of contents of glass. To raise the percentage of ice to the ideal of around 50% you should use a 14oz Collins glass or a Spanish style Copa glass.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3181f0dad1.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Vodka Soda","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"132 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Vodka","150 ml Soda (club soda) water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"POUR ingredients into ice-filled glass and lightly stir (so as not to lose fizz)"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Donâ€™t serve with straws"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"vodka-soda","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4280/vodka-soda"}
