Honey does indeed make for a tasty cocktail and is stipulated in the Brown Derby recipe that appears in George Buzza Jr.'s, 1933 Hollywood Cocktails. However, according to the 1930 The Savoy Cocktail Book, when made with honey this cocktail is a De Rigueur Cocktail.\r\rWhatever the name, I prefer this cocktail made with maple syrup, as unless you have a very full-bodied honey, maple syrup's 'tang' sits better with the bourbon and grapefruit combo.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fe6c93d4c.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Brown Derby","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"162 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Whiskey - Bourbon whiskey","30 ml Pink grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Maple syrup"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"brown-derby","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3246/brown-derby"}
