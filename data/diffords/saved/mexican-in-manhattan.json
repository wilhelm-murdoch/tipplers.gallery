I also started with my favourite addition to a Sweet Manhattan: a half spoon of syrup from the maraschino cherry jar, but añejo tequila is so much more suited to maraschino liqueur. So I switched sweet vermouth for bianco vermouth and Angostura Bitters for lavender bitters. (I love the combination of tequila and lavender.) Hope you like the result.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30b961634d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Mexican in Manhattan","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"181 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Tequila anejo","2.5 ml Maraschino liqueur","30 ml Bianco vermouth","3 Lavender bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"mexican-in-manhattan","standardDrinks":"2.5","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4056/mexican-in-manhattan"}
