A wish for those to come. The story of a journey and what stands behind it. The story of what stands by our side. A line to follow and a line to draw. A bottle, a boat, and my grandma's kitchen.\"\r\rWe say: I prefer 2:1 sugar syrup to caster sugar so I used 10ml in this recipe rather than the situlated \"3 barspoons caster sugar\". I love what the dry sherry adds to this Daiquiri but given the addition of salt perhaps manzanilla sherry would have been more appropriate than fino? Remembering this is a Legacy competition drink the \"no garnish\" seems a shame - poor drink is being send out to compete against the world undressed.\r\r(For the dry sherry, Livio’s prefers to use Lustau Almacenista José Luis González Obregón)","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af302c299794.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"El Especialista","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"145 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Fino sherry","30 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","3 White caster sugar","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","1 Salt"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"el-especialista","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3910/el-especialista"}
