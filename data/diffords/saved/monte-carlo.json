My hero, the tax lawyer and cocktail writer, David Embury, says in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, \"This drink is a bit on the sweet side. It can be improved by adding 2 parts lemon juice and increasing the rye from 2 parts to about 4 or 5.\" Embury had a dry palate approaching that of Hemingway's and most palates will appreciate the extra touch of sweetness in this cocktail that's best enjoyed as an after-dinner tipple or nightcap.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/07/5f0ec229d5e2d.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Monte Carlo","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"183 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Straight rye whiskey (100 proof / 50% alc./vol.)","15 ml Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur","1 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ive and strain into ice-filled glass (preferably over a large cube or chunk of block ice)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"monte-carlo","standardDrinks":"3.1","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2506/monte-carlo"}
