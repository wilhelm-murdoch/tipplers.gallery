BACARDÍ was at the centre of this ‘golden age of cocktails’ – and today it hosts bartenders from around the globe to create, share and display a new generation of drinks that will be part of the BACARDÍ Legacy and culture. I want to honour the grace, virtuosity and graciousness of these bartenders, and add my drink to this legacy.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fe7cb9a69.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Buena Vida (by Gonzalo Cabado)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"166 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","22.5 ml Martini Riserva Speciale Bitter","22.5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Cardamom honey"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"buena-vida-by-gonzalo-cabado","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3996/buena-vida-by-gonzalo-cabado"}
