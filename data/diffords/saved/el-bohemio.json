This brought me back to the origins of BACARDÍ rum, with Don Facundo Bacardí Masso’s radical new way of producing rum, and with my own heritage from the Czech Republic, otherwise known as Bohemia. \r\rMy legacy is to honor the free thinkers who are not afraid to go in their own direction and to support the creatives who do not fear the reaction of others - for this is the true bohemian mindset.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2b324e071.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"El Bohemio","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"179 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["40 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Becherovka liqueur","30 ml Pink grapefruit juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix)","2 Absinthe verte (green)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"el-bohemio","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4756/el-bohemio"}
