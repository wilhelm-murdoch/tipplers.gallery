In 1880, the darkest era of our rum, Emilio Bacardi knew how to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, more brilliant and perfect than before.\r\rRum is warmth, it is the Caribbean, and it is love. Who hasn’t played with fire? We all must unleash our inner flame at least once; for the fear of burning up must not outweigh the fear of extinguishment.\r\rToday, I want to leave you my fire.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2253dcc8e.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Fuego","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"141 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","15 ml Dry vermouth","5 ml Malbec red wine","10 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","5 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","1 Hot pepper sauce (red)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Homemade cinnamon and star anise syrup"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"fuego","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4732/fuego"}
