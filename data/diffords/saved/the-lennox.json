What are my fears? What do I stand for? What do I want people to remember me for? What will be my legacy? \r\r“I began to look back over the course of my bartending career, which began when I was 18, taking me from South Africa to New York working in restaurant bars, before returning to South Africa to work in my first cocktail bar – ‘The Lennox.’ It was here, surrounded by bright colored syrups, fresh fruit, juices and frozen daiquiris, that I learnt the importance of self expression, non-conformism and how to host an incredible fun-filled experience!\r\r“The Lennox is passion, dedication and bravery. The same characteristics that Don Facunda Bacardí expressed through his beautiful rum: the first of its kind – created to bring people together and to celebrate life.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af315fd8708e.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"The Lennox","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"179 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","15 ml Pedro Ximénez sherry","15 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","15 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","2 Pimento bitters","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e Homemade banana syrup (1:1)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"the-lennox","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3937/the-lennox"}
