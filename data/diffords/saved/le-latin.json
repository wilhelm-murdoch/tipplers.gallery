Sugar cane and rum are the Cuban touch of my cocktail; lemon is the specific citrus and wine represents the French vineyard. A green olive and its brine balances the cocktail with its salty touch.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3096be4af2.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Le Latin","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"150 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Voignier white wine","20 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Olive brine (from jarred olive)","10 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0°brix)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"le-latin","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3992/le-latin"}
