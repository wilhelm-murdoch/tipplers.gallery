After a long road, saying goodbye to the streets and my old lifestyle, I found salvation in bartending and began chasing my dream to become one of the best. Like my drink, life is a mix of bitter, sweet and a solid base that makes you the person you are. You are your legacy, wherever in the future you may stand.  Bartending literally saved my life; that is what Herencia is all about.”","glassWare":"Rocks glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/36/2018f106f83839bd657f3f5c42708773ea02.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Herencia","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"179 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","5 ml Pedro Ximénez sherry","10 ml Fino sherry","5 ml Cinnamon sugar syrup","1 Chocolate bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"(Henri’s original recipe calls for 10 ml Cinnamon syrup which he makes with 1 kg sugar, 1 litre water and 8 cinnamon sticks heated until sugar is dissolved then rested and strained"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":")"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"herencia","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4410/herencia"}
