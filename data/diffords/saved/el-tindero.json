As I researched into him, a very clear picture of him formed in my mind. He is the epitome of the ultimate sales man; one that has passion, confidence, motivation and who values family. \r\r\"I dedicate this cocktail to my father Roberto Cruz who reminds me so much of Don Facundo; it also honours all bartenders who possess the same qualities as Don Facundo. El Tindero is best served as an after dinner drink.\"\r\rWe say: Strangely reminiscent of a 'lager shandy' with very subdued coconut notes. It's a very tasty lager shandy though.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af302e4cfdc1.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"El Tindero","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"160 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Pilsner lager","50 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","30 ml Coconut water","10 ml Demerara/Muscovado/brown sugar syrup (2 sugar:1 water)","5 ml Apple Cider vinegar","4 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"POUR beer into chilled glass and set aside"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE other ingredients with ice and fine strain into beer charged glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Finally add ice to glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"el-tindero","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3902/el-tindero"}
