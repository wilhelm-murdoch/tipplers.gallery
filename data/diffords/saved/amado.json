Of course, it had some bitter times too which seasoned our life and brought us closer, just like the Angostura in this drink. And Bacard√≠, which is the soul of my cocktail. If this drink soothes your palate, it's a cocktail; but if it soothes your soul, it's a LEGACY.\"\r\rWe say: A rose flavoured daiquiri - what's not to like? We followed the recipe using Monin rose syrup but the result was too sweet and floral. Then we tried 10ml which was a tad too sour. Bang in the middle hit the spot but then we started playing around with Turkish rose water and sugar syrup before remembering this was somebody else's recipe. Cries out for a Turkish delight as a garnish.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fb491b880.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Amado","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"177 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Rose sugar syrup","20 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)","1 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain back into shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"DRY SHAKE (without ice) and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"amado","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3913/amado"}
