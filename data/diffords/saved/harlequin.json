I used this tonic as inspiration and thought it would work well with BACARDÍ Carta Blanca.\r \r“I tried many ways of giving the drink bitterness but eventually settled on using MARTINI Bianco vermouth; it matched both the rum and the celery beautifully. The drink came together with the addition of fresh lime and agave syrup to give it balance, body and richness. I decided to call it Harlequin because the drink has strong characteristics that work well together.”","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30674adb1f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Harlequin","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"197 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Bianco vermouth","10 ml Celery juice (freshly extracted)","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Agave syrup","25 ml Soda (club soda) water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first 5 ingredients with ice and fine into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with soda water"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"harlequin","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3994/harlequin"}
