Most of all, the most ‘simple’ BACARDí rum: Carta Blanca, with its light notes of vanilla and citrus. I wanted to enhance and bring out these aromas and to create a drink that changes with the bartenders that mix it, like a Martini cocktail - to create a new experience for guests around the world.”","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f27c1985f2.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Ascético","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"141 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","10 ml Riesling wine","5 ml Elderflower syrup","6 Balsamic vinegar of Modena"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"ascetico","standardDrinks":"1.8","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4745/ascetico"}
