Proportions range from equal parts (45ml scotch to 45ml amaretto) to 4:1 (60ml scotch to 15ml amaretto), and even as dry as 8:1 (60ml scotch to 7.5ml amaretto), but we find 3:1 (60ml scotch to 20ml amaretto) is just enough amaretto to take the edge off the scotch and add a pleasing almondy note without overpowering the flavour of the whisky.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30573ed528.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Godfather Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"207 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Blended Scotch whisky","20 ml Amaretto liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"godfather-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/864/godfather-cocktail"}
