For my version of this classic, I've used bonded strength rye whisky so you need to up the measure if using standard strength rye. I've also used a 'rich' 2:1 grenadine syrup. If using homemade 1:1 syrup pomegranate syrup for your grenadine, up the measure to 10ml (1/3oz) and omit the sugar syrup. Homemade syrup produces a rust-coloured cocktail while with commercial grenadine the result is likely to be more vibrant. The quality of your pomegranate syrup/grenadine will make or break the finished cocktail.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2022/07/62d14c856f124.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Scoff-law"],"name":"Scofflaw","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"153 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Straight rye whiskey (100 proof / 50% alc./vol.)","30 ml Dry vermouth","10 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","5 ml Grenadine/pomegranate syrup (2:1)","2.5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","1 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters (optional)","2 Saline solution 4:1 (20g sea salt to 80g water) (optional)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"scofflaw","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1755/scofflaw"}
