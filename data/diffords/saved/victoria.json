It arose from a legacy of family, friends and fellow bartenders who, with work, commitment and passion, show that anything can be achieved. Victoria is the middle name of Amalia, the wife of Don Facundo Bacardí. \r\rMy drink is an aperitif cocktail, best enjoyed after work when the BACARDÍ Carta Blanca will open and activate the appetite.”","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2f4e2c1bb.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Victoria","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"105 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","15 ml Triple sec liqueur (40% alc./vol.)","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","1 Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass over a cube of 1 cube of hibiscus-infused ice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"victoria","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4771/victoria"}
