The style of dark \"black strap\" rum now often floated to give this cocktail an oil slick-like dark top is not traditional in Barbados, this drink's home but is does aid its appearance. To be authentic to its origins you should obviously use a Barbadian rum and forego the oil slick.\r\rThere does seem to be a general acceptance that whatever rum or combination of rums (and brandy) are used, the base spirit is usually a 60ml (2oz) measure mixed with 15ml (½oz) falernum. \r\rOnce decided on base spirit then you have a choice of whether to add \"red bitters\" (Angostura) or \"green bitters\" (absinthe), and how many dashes.\r\rFinally, your choice of ice – cubed or crushed. There are camps that argue for both.\r\rLike all drinks, I'd advise you make your Corn 'N' Oils to suit your tastes or those of your guests.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/07/5f0588cf5cb96.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Corn and oil","Corning Oil","Corn ‘n’ Oil","Corn \u0026 Oil"],"name":"Corn'n'Oil Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"210 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Caribbean blended rum aged 6-10 years","15 ml Falernum liqueur","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","15 ml Dark/black/blackstrap rum"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR first 3 ingredients with ice and strain into glass filled with crushed ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"FLOAT black rum on surface of the drink"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"cornnoil-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3029/cornnoil-cocktail"}
