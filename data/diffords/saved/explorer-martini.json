Made with cream sherry, as per the original recipe, brings out the rich marzipan notes in the amaretto to produce a richer after-dinner cocktail.\r\rIn contrast, a fino sherry dries this cocktail to make it more ap√©ritif in style with nutty flavours to the fore.\r\rAmontillado sherry (as in our rendition) amplifies butterscotch and we think is best-served on-the-rocks in an old-fashioned as a late-night tipple. An extremely versatile equal parts recipe to appeal to all palates.","glassWare":"Martini glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/11/5de11b5e1efe9.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Explorer 'Martini'","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"211 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Blended Scotch whisky","30 ml Amaretto liqueur","30 ml Amontillado sherry"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"explorer-martini","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4896/explorer-martini"}
