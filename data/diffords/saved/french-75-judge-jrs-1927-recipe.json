Fill up the rest of a tall glass with champagne!\" I've loosely interpreted this recipe to the one above (with the 3 spoons of powdered sugar being flat 5ml measuring spoons). The result is dangerously quaffable gin spiked champagne with a zesty lemon bite. The powered sugar adds an attractive sherbet note, but if you prefer to use sugar syrup then substitute with Â½oz/15ml (2:1).","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af304448a7b9.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"French 75 (Judge Jr's 1927 recipe)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"159 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","3 Powdered sugar (ground in mortar and pestle) (or use 5ml of 2:1 sugar syrup per spoon)","45 ml Gin","90 ml Brut champagne or sparkling wine"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR powdered sugar with lemon juice in base of shaker until sugar dissolves"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add gin, SHAKE with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with champagne and lightly stir"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"french-75-judge-jrs-1927-recipe","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4237/french-75-judge-jrs-1927-recipe"}
