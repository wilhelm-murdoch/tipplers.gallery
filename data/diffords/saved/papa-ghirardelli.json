He went on to found Ghirardely \u0026 Girard (later changed to the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company), which has been in continuous operation since 1852. In his own way, Ghirardelli helped build and shape San Francisco, and his company has become synonymous with the city. Ghirardelli Square, which his company-built, has been an official city landmark since 1965.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30e40955ce.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Papa Ghirardelli","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"157 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Pisco","15 ml Italian red bitter liqueur","22.5 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","15 ml Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur","15 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","30 ml Soda (club soda) water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first five ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with soda"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"papa-ghirardelli","standardDrinks":"2.5","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3004/papa-ghirardelli"}
