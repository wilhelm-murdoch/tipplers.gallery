I have lived in Spain, England, Poland and now Switzerland; these places, every new person I have met and each new skill I have learnt has shaped who I am now.\r\r“Being deeply attached to your roots does not mean standing in one place. Each ingredient in this cocktail relates to something important to my still-evolving story and connects it with the ever-evolving history of BACARDÍ rum.”","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/40/20187944f1f1cdeb2be46adee8deea484c6f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Las Raices","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"185 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","20 ml Coffee liqueur","10 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","1/2 Balsamic vinegar of Modena"," Tonic water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE first 4 ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"TOP with tonic water"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Vanilla brown sugar cane syrup (simmer 1:1 brown sugar cane and water"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add one vanilla pod cut in half, stir until sugar dissolves and cool)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"las-raices","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4427/las-raices"}
