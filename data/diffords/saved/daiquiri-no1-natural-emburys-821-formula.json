Embury","datePublished":"2015-07-13 12:43:44","description":"Traditionally a Daiquiri should always be based on light rum but if I should feel like breaking with tradition and using aged rum, I find Embury's 8:2:1 formula works particularly well with a sweet aged rum. However, with drier aged rums, depending on the sourness of the limes, I up the sugar from 7.5ml (representing 1 part from the 8:2:1 formula) towards 10ml (as in the recipe above). So, depending on your rum and limes, 12:3:2 may be better than 8:2:1.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2021/10/61602784c87f6.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Daiquiri No.1 Natural (Embury's 8:2:1 formula)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"204 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Caribbean blended rum aged 6-10 years","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)","4 Vanilla bitters (optional)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"daiquiri-no1-natural-emburys-821-formula","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2153/daiquiri-no1-natural-emburys-821-formula"}
