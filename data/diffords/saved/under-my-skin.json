The basic inspiration was the classic BACARD√ç Daiquiri, for me one of the best drinks ever invented. The name \"Under My Skin\" is inspired firstly by the ingredients that, when combined, will get under your skin; secondly by the Frank Sinatra song \"Under My Skin\" about a woman he can never get enough of. This is the impression I wanted to create with this drink.\"","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af31784c9ac8.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Under My Skin","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"141 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["2.5 ml Absinthe verte (green)","2 Green cardamom pods","60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","25 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","10 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SPRAY glass with absinthe"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled absinthe misted glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Vanilla flavored honey"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"under-my-skin","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4004/under-my-skin"}
