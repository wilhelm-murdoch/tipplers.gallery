We settled in Washington, DC. - a new place in which to build new lives whilst holding on to our Island roots - like the Bacardí family, when they were forced out of Cuba and settled in Puerto Rico.\r\r“Leaving the islands taught me a crucial early lesson for success in any aspect of life: you must draw strength from your roots, and never fear embracing new experiences and ways of thinking to overcome the unforeseen obstacles that lie ahead. That is what the Bacardí family has done for over 150 years and what Coki Beach means to me.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/4/48/201864b6211a4ec4810c7278f47f5c427f32.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Coki Beach","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"157 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Ocho Anos","7.5 ml Pimento dram liqueur","30 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","20 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Toasted coconut syrup (toast 720g of unsweetened coconut flakes on low heat until golden brown"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add 720ml water, bring to boil and remove from heat"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Cover and steep for 25 minutes, strain and add equal parts sugar"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":")"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"coki-beach","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4432/coki-beach"}
