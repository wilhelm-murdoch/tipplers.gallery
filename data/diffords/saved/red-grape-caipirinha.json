Cut lime in half (from pole to pole) and then slice one of the halves into eight 3-4mm thick half-moon shaped segments and drop into the base of a robust rocks glass.\r\r2. Add 3 bar spoons caster sugar (or ½oz / 15ml sugar syrup 2:1) and MUDDLE.\r\r3. Add grapes and MUDDLE some more.\r\r4. When sure fruit juice is fully extracted and the sugar dissolved, transfer the muddled fruit and sugar into serving glass (preferably a 30cl / 10oz hi-ball glass).\r\r5. POUR cachaça (stored in the freezer) into the rocks glass (used to muddle) and swirl to rinse glass before pouring cachaça into serving glass. STIR to ensure all ingredients are well mixed.\r\r6. Crack (rather than crush) four to five large ice cubes and drop into serving glass. STIR before topping with more ice and serve with a stirrer (but no straws).","glassWare":"Highball (max 10oz/300ml)","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af310f1ed701.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Red Grape Caipirinha","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"134 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1/2 Lime (fresh) (chopped)","3 White caster sugar","8 Red grapes (seedless)","60 ml Cachaça (from freezer)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Cut lime in half (from pole to pole) and then slice one of the halves into eight 3-4mm thick half-moon shaped segments and drop into the base of a robust rocks glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Add 3 bar spoons caster sugar (or ½oz / 15ml sugar syrup 2:1) and MUDDLE"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Add grapes and MUDDLE some more"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e4"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e When sure fruit juice is fully extracted and the sugar dissolved, transfer the muddled fruit and sugar into serving glass (preferably a 30cl / 10oz hi-ball glass)"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e5"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e POUR cachaça (stored in the freezer) into the rocks glass (used to muddle) and swirl to rinse glass before pouring cachaça into serving glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR to ensure all ingredients are well mixed"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003e6"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003c/strong\u003e Crack (rather than crush) four to five large ice cubes and drop into serving glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR before topping with more ice and serve with a stirrer (but no straws)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"red-grape-caipirinha","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4138/red-grape-caipirinha"}
