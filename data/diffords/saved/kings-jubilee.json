Don't be tempted to drop the cherry garnish into the drink or both appearance and balance will be muddied. Skewer the cherry and reserve for a sweet treat at the end. \r\rMy original take on this classic (up until July 2020) was 60ml light rum, 22.5ml maraschino liqueur and 15ml lemon juice but this packs a whopping 80ml of alcohol. The above recipe scales this back by a third to still pack a double shot punch, but in a drink that hopefully won't be a killer blow to the night.","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/07/5f0edada71ca6.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Kings Jubilee"],"name":"King's Jubilee","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"120 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["40 ml White (charcoal-filtered) 1-4 year old light rum","15 ml Maraschino liqueur","10 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"kings-jubilee","standardDrinks":"1.7","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2880/kings-jubilee"}
