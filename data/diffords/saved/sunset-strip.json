Being a mix of split base spirits and liqueurs it was stirred, as you'd expect of such a combination. However, somewhat reminiscent of Shakerato, the Sunset Strip seems to benefit from the aeration and extra dilution provided by shaking, hence this is the method I've chosen.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3149029499.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Sunset Strip","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"243 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["22.5 ml Straight rye whiskey (100 proof / 50% alc./vol.)","22.5 ml Tennessee whiskey","30 ml Pamplemousse rosé (pink grapefruit) liqueur","30 ml Bittersweet orange-red aperitivo"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"sunset-strip","standardDrinks":"1.9","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3662/sunset-strip"}
