Fittingly different whiskies in the drink represent England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. London dry gin, British ale and Drambuie are all obviously British, and with names such as Cox, Granny Smith and Kingston Black, apples are intrinsically a Great British fruit, as indeed is the strawberry (think of Wimbledon), so the obvious garnish.\r\rHandily, Drambuie contains Scotch whisky so naturally mixes well with the other whiskies, and apple juice is a favourite fruit among bartenders to use in whiskey cocktails.\r\rThe name is inspired by the Union Jack and also what I thought when I'd successfully combined all the above into one tasty cocktail.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af307e92f221.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Jack Pot","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"187 calories"},"prepTime":"PT05M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["15 ml Drambuie liqueur","7.5 ml Blended Scotch whisky","7.5 ml Whisky - Peated Scotch whisky","7.5 ml Irish whiskey","7.5 ml Single malt Welsh whisky","22.5 ml Gin","45 ml British bitter ale","7.5 ml Apple juice (apple cider) unsweetened \u0026 cloudy"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"jack-pot","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT05M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3260/jack-pot"}
