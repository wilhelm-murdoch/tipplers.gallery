It also honours the fact that Facundo’s wife Amalia came from a family of coffee farmers. Following the earthquake of 1852 that destroyed the first distillery, it was money derived from coffee, from Amalia’s family, that was used to invest in Facundo’s idea to create a light bodied white rum.\r \r“The golden coffee bean and unique flavour of the ‘Santiago Moment’ pays homage to this special moment in BACARDÍ’s history.”","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3123824a36.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Santiago Moment","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"163 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","2.5 ml Coffee liqueur","7.5 ml Crème de cassis liqueur","20 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)","2 Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","1/6 Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"santiago-moment","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4015/santiago-moment"}
