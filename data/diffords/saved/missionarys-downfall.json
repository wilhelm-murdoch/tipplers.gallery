The original recipe calls for peach brandy (distilled from fermented peaches) rather than peach liqueur (based on neutral spirit) but due to its clarity and clean flavour, I prefer peach schnapps as a substitute.\r\rMany recipes are blended with both fresh mint and pineapple and while blending the mint gives the drink a vibrant green colour it does resemble stagnant pond water and looks like something you'd only drink for the promise of perceived health-giving properties rather than for pleasure. Hence, my version is shaken, but be sure to muddle generous amounts of mint well to impart both colour and flavour.","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30c0a77b62.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Missionary's Downfall","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"141 calories"},"prepTime":"PT05M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["15 Mint leaves","30 ml White/gold 1-3 year old mellow light rum","15 ml Peach schnapps liqueur","10 ml Honey syrup (3 honey to 1 water)","15 ml Pineapple juice (fresh pressed)","15 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Lightly MUDDLE mint with rum in base of shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add other ingredients, SHAKE with ice and fine strain into glass filled with crushed ice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"missionarys-downfall","standardDrinks":"1.2","totalTime":"PT05M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1334/missionarys-downfall"}
