I also doubled the Creole bitters. For those who liked the previous recipe:\r30 ml Bourbon\r30 ml Cognac\r30 ml Rosso vermouth \r10 ml Bénédictine D.O.M. (this was 7.5ml pre-April 2020 \u0026 in my 15th book)\r1 dash Aromatic bitters\r1 dash Creole-style bitters\r\rMy quest for the perfect Vieux Carré continued in June 2022 when I succumbed to the calls to use rye in place of bourbon, in keeping with the original recipe. For the record, I tried a 50/50 mix of the two whiskies but this did not work as well as either just bourbon or indeed rye.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/5/44/201865e3ae1f3c933fd1cbe780a3e45d0b48.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Vieux Carré Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"168 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["22.5 ml Straight rye whiskey (100 proof / 50% alc./vol.)","22.5 ml Cognac (brandy)","22.5 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","10 ml Bénédictine D.O.M. liqueur","2 Peychaud's or other Creole-style bitters","1 Angostura or other aromatic bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into ice-filled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"vieux-carre-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/2048/vieux-carre-cocktail"}
