What's not to like?\r\rThe Brandy Old-Fashioned is often made using Californian brandy and depending on the sweetness of your brandy you may want to reduce the sugar syrup in this recipe. Use a wedge, rather than a slice, of orange as when muddled a slice breaks up too much leaving unsightly debris in the drink.","glassWare":"Old-fashioned glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2020/07/5f06f661b6cb7.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Wisconsin Brandy Old Fashioned","Wisconsin Old Fashioned"],"name":"Brandy Old Fashioned (Wisconsin-style)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"153 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["1 Orange (fresh fruit)","1 Maraschino cherry (from jar in syrup)","5 ml Demerara/Muscovado/brown sugar syrup (2 sugar:1 water)","2 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","60 ml Cognac (brandy)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"MUDDLE first 4 ingredients in base of glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add brandy and 6oz scoop crushed ice"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"brandy-old-fashioned-wisconsin-style","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/5101/brandy-old-fashioned-wisconsin-style"}
