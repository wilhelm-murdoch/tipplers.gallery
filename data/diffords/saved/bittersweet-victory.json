Bittersweet Victory's ingredients mirror this idea: the lows that come with life are reflected through the bitter liquor and lime juice; the highs, on the other hand, can be tasted through the sweetness of the maple syrup. The successes that life brings with it are represented by Bacard√≠, as the company has surpassed many hurdles in its history to enjoy numerous achievements and personal victories.\"\r\rWe say: Very slightly on the tart side of balanced with rich maple syrup set against bitter aperitivo and lime juice.
