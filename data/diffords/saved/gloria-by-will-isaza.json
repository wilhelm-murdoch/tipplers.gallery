It stems from the culinary inspiration of a ‘Bocadillo:’ a Colombian small bite usually comprising something sweet and savoury cheese. The name Gloria is the direct translation of ‘glory’ and is also the name of my mother. \r\rI was inspired to create a legacy that uses family, tradition, glory and BACARDÍ Añejo Cuatro rum. Using those four pillars of success, I hope to create much more than just a cocktail - better yet, a movement!”","glassWare":"Collins glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2019/07/5d1f2f90032a5.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Gloria (by Will Isaza)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"126 calories"},"prepTime":"PT04M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["40 ml Bacardi Añejo Cuatro","25 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","25 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","10 ml Coffee liqueur","1 Mascarpone cheese"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain into glass filled with crushed ice"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Passion fruit cinnamon syrup"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Combine equal parts by weight passion fruit puree and white sugar"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Mix until sugar is fully dissolved"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Over medium heat combine equal parts by weight white sugar and water"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add 6 cinnamon sticks and heat until sugar is fully dissolved"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Leave for 12 hours"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Strain out cinnamon sticks"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Combine 2 parts Cinnamon Syrup and 1 part Passion Fruit Syrup"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Stir until fully incorporated"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"gloria-by-will-isaza","standardDrinks":"2.1","totalTime":"PT04M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4772/gloria-by-will-isaza"}
