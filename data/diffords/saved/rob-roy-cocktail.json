The Rob Roy is classically made with Angostura Bitters but in his 1948 The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks, as a footnote below his recipe, David Embury attests \"Peychaud, somehow, seems to blend better than Angostura with Scotch.\"\r\rI find Abbott's Bitters combines more harmoniously with the whisky in this cocktail. Or if not to hand, I use one dash Angostura-style aromatic bitters and one dash Peychaud's/creole bitters. Whatever bitters you use their inclusion is essential to the balance and complexity of this cocktail.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af3114e9e497.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Scotch Manhattan"],"name":"Rob Roy Cocktail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"174 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Blended Scotch whisky","30 ml Rosso/rouge (sweet) vermouth","8 Abbott's bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"rob-roy-cocktail","standardDrinks":"2.4","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1681/rob-roy-cocktail"}
