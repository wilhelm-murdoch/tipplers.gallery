As a child, when I went to visit my dad for the summer, he would take us up to a berry farm in California to pick raspberries. We picked so many of them that we weren't able to eat them all, so we made them into a syrup to mix with our lemonade. I was then inspired by great classics like the Bacardí Cocktail, a Knickerbocker, and a Clover Club - drinks that were among the first I learned how to make when I left the States for New Zealand. The name El Vestido was inspired by the style, sophistication, and elegance of the BACARDÍ brand, and GQ Bar where I was working when I created this cocktail.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af302e592371.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"El Vestido","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"109 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","7.5 ml Fino sherry","22.5 ml *Special ingredient #1 (see above)","22.5 ml Lime juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)","8 Mint leaves"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"DRY SHAKE (without ice) first 5 ingredients with ice and strain back into shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add mint leaves, SHAKE with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"#"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"\u003cstrong\u003eSpecial ingredient #1\u003c/strong\u003e: Homemade raspberry syrup (1:1)"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"el-vestido","standardDrinks":"2.3","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3934/el-vestido"}
