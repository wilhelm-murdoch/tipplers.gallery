However, who knows what brix the original grenadine/pomegranate syrup was, so we've eased back the grenadine to bring modern day ingredients more into kilter. The resulting drink (which benefits from a splash of water to aid dilution), remains more a fruity spirituous after-dinner cocktail rather than an aperitif.","glassWare":"Nick \u0026 Nora glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af313b159d70.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Soixante-Quinze (Washington Herald 1915 recipe)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"118 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["20 ml Gin","20 ml Applejack brandy bottled-in-bond (50% alc./vol)","10 ml Grenadine/pomegranate syrup (2:1)","5 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Chilled water"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"soixante-quinze-washington-herald-1915-recipe","standardDrinks":"1.5","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/4236/soixante-quinze-washington-herald-1915-recipe"}
