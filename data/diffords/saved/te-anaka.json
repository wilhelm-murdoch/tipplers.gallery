Just as Don Facundo found his calling refining the rum making process, I've found mine in hospitality making cocktails. Te Anaka is my Legacy cocktail and my interpretation of the place I now call home, Wanaka, inspired by both the produce around me and by the flavour profile of Bacard√≠ Carta Blanca. Te Anaka is my way of sharing this beautiful place, my home, with the world and showing people everywhere that they too can create paradise and enjoy Wanaka.\" \r\rWe say: Reminiscent of a Honeysuckle Daiquiri with salty sherry notes. The rum, fino sherry, honey and lemon juice combine brilliantly, smoothed and made frothy with egg white.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af31502e41f3.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Te Anaka","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"215 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["45 ml Bacardi Carta Blanca","30 ml Honey water (1:1)","15 ml Fino sherry","15 ml Lemon juice (freshly squeezed)","15 ml Pasteurised egg white (or aquafaba)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"SHAKE all ingredients with ice and strain back into shaker"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"DRY SHAKE (without ice) and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"te-anaka","standardDrinks":"1.6","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3904/te-anaka"}
