There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing moment. The first sip of the cocktail is pink, full of berry aromas, like the first time you saw your loved one. Berries are followed by apricots, to help you to get to know each other. Muscovado sugar smokiness and a floral touch give you wings, so you can do anything for your loved one. And then comes passion... passion that cannot be tamed - like Bacardí. Feel the love!\"\r\rWe say: We found this drink benefits from being slightly generous when measuring the sugar syrup. The result is a boozy sipper of a cocktail that feels like it should be made with eight year old rum.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af30bb3078de.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"MiAmor","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"161 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["50 ml Bacardi Carta Oro","20 ml Rosato/rosé vermouth","2.5 ml Apricot (brandy) liqueur","5 ml Demerara/Muscovado/brown sugar syrup (2 sugar:1 water)","2 Orange bitters"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and fine strain onto chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"miamor","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/3919/miamor"}
