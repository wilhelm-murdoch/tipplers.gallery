A spoon full of sugar certainly helps the medicine go down where the Pink Gin is concerned and the use of Old Tom gin is worth considering. However, the more sugar you add the less dilution you'll need. Hit the perfect balance (hopefully our recipe) and this is a great drink, but it's an equilibrium that's tricky to attain.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2021/09/6139fe643411f.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe"],"name":"Pink Gin","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"151 calories"},"prepTime":"PT02M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["60 ml Gin","30 ml Chilled water (reduce if wet ice)","3 Angostura or other aromatic bitters","5 ml Sugar syrup 'rich' (2 sugar to 1 water, 65.0Â°brix)"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and fine strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"pink-gin","standardDrinks":"2.2","totalTime":"PT02M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/1544/pink-gin"}
