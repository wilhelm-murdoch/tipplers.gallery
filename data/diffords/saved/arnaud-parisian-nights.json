An interesting balance of blackcurrant, vermouth and gin. Some might describe it as \"alcoholic Ribena and I've tried upping the gin and reducing the cassis to make drier e.g. 40ml Gin, 30ml Dry vermouth and 20ml Crème de cassis. However, this is best served with equal parts as a dessert Martini at its rich and indulgent best.","glassWare":"Coupe glass","image":"https://cdn.diffords.com/contrib/stock-images/2018/05/5af2fbfc1257a.jpg","keywords":["Drink","Cocktail","Recipe","Arnaud Martini"],"name":"Arnaud (Parisian Nights)","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"180 calories"},"prepTime":"PT03M0S","recipeCategory":"Drink","recipeCuisine":"Cocktail","recipeIngredient":["30 ml Gin","30 ml Dry vermouth","30 ml Crème de cassis liqueur"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"STIR all ingredients with ice and strain into chilled glass"}],"recipeYield":"1","slug":"arnaud-parisian-nights","standardDrinks":"2","totalTime":"PT03M0S","url":"https://www.diffordsguide.com/en-au/cocktails/recipe/107/arnaud-parisian-nights"}
