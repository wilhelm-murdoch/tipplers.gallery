Named for the monstrous, toothy creature that Jabba the Hutt would feed his victims to in \u0026quot;Return of the Jedi,\u0026quot; this delicious drink was created by bartender Timothy Miner of New York City\u0026#39;s beloved Long Island Bar.The Rancor\u0026#39;s Toothpick takes the classic\u0026amp;nbsp;Boulevardier cocktail, swapping out the traditional ingredients for a more unique flavor profile.One ingredient in this cocktail is cynar, an artichoke-based liqueur that delivers subtle vegetal notes, making it a perfect substitute for\u0026amp;nbsp;Campari. The result is a well-balanced drink that is perfect for sipping on a warm evening.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429073624-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429073624-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429073624-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Rancor’s Toothpick","Rancor’s Toothpick Recipe","Rancor’s Toothpick Cocktail","Rancor’s Toothpick Cocktail Recipe","How To Rancor’s Toothpick"],"name":"Rancor’s Toothpick","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
