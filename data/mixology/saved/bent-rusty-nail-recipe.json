It\u0026#39;s simple, delicious, and boozy as hell!The ingredients include 2 Scottish liquors–Scotch Whisky or Drambuie (a type of honey-infused bourbon). Since we can\u0026#39;t find it in the US right now, we want to make sure you still get to enjoy the taste of the classic rusty nail.We substituted this Drambuie spirit with the Garrison Brothers Honey Dew honey-infused whiskey, which sounds crazy delicious—Hence, the name “Bent Rusty Nail.”","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220222094439-a-20glass-20of-20bent-20rusty-20nail.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220222094439-a-20glass-20of-20bent-20rusty-20nail.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220222094439-a-20glass-20of-20bent-20rusty-20nail.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Bent Rusty Nail","Bent Rusty Nail Recipe","Bent Rusty Nail Cocktail","How To Bent Rusty Nail","Bent Rusty Nail Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Bent Rusty Nail","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
