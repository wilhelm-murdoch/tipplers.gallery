The cocktail is strong and cold and should not be taken lightly. But if you\u0026#39;re into classic cocktails with a unique twist, look no further than this concoction.This drink dates back to the late 18th century when British sailors needed vitamin C to keep scurvy at bay. Limes were added to the drink to make it more palatable, and\u0026amp;nbsp;vodka soon replaced\u0026amp;nbsp;gin as the spirit of choice.
