This juicy take on the\u0026amp;nbsp;classic Julep from Lynette Marrero is colored using peach slices and features a foamy head from the IPA syrup.The hoppy flavor of the IPA syrup is balanced by the sweetness of the peaches and the bourbon. To really enjoy this summertime Peach Beer Julep cocktail, serve it in a Julep cup mounded with crushed ice. This will help keep the drink cold and prevent it from getting watered down.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524013008-glasses-20of-20peach-20beer-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524013008-glasses-20of-20peach-20beer-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524013008-glasses-20of-20peach-20beer-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Peach Beer Julep","How To Peach Beer Julep","Peach Beer Julep Cocktail","Peach Beer Julep Recipe","Peach Beer Julep Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Peach Beer Julep","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1 cup Sugar","12 oz.
