To make it even more invigorating and summery, add cucumber. This will twist the cocktail into a sweetly herbaceous drink that is reminiscent of an afternoon at the spa.For this particular drink, it is best to use a lighter and more floral\u0026amp;nbsp;gin in order to emphasize the notes that the cucumber adds. The Gimlet is a perfect poolside sipper or veranda drink that will please any crowd.The traditional recipe calls for gin and lime juice, but there are many delicious variations of this drink, such as Cucumber, Basil \u0026amp;amp; Lime Gimlet, which replaces the gin with\u0026amp;nbsp;vodka and adds basil and a splash of\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026amp;nbsp;lemonade to the mix.Or, you can include cucumber juice like the\u0026amp;nbsp;Cucumber Juice Gimlet to create your own unique flavor combination. So whether you’re a traditional mixologist or an experimental one, this Gimlet is for you.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524014432-a-20glass-20of-20cucumber-20gimlet.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524014432-a-20glass-20of-20cucumber-20gimlet.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524014432-a-20glass-20of-20cucumber-20gimlet.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Cucumber Gimlet","How To Cucumber Gimlet","Cucumber Gimlet Cocktail","Cucumber Gimlet Recipe","Cucumber Gimlet Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Cucumber Gimlet","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
