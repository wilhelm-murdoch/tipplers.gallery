The\u0026amp;nbsp;Mint Julep is the most famous of these drinks, typically made with whiskey. However, the cocktail\u0026#39;s hallmark combination of spirit, mint, sugar, and crushed ice works beyond whiskey and lends itself to experimentation.The Gin on Gin Julep is one of its variations and begins like most traditional juleps—with muddling mint and simple syrup together in the bottom of the glass. Add the\u0026amp;nbsp;gin, then top the liquids with as much crushed ice as you can reasonably fit into the vessel.This cocktail is perfect for\u0026amp;nbsp;hot summer days, and a splash of\u0026amp;nbsp;club soda brings balance to the strong spirits and sweet sugar. Most importantly, it hints effervescence that really makes the drink come alive.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506114001-a_glass_of_gin_on_gin_julep-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506114001-a_glass_of_gin_on_gin_julep-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506114001-a_glass_of_gin_on_gin_julep-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Gin On Gin Julep","How To Gin On Gin Julep","Gin On Gin Julep Cocktail","Gin On Gin Julep Recipe","Gin On Gin Julep Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Gin On Gin Julep","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["½ oz.
