So whether you\u0026#39;re using fresh strawberries, blueberries, or even mango, Pineapple Rosemary Crush is always a winner.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526014511-a-20glass-20of-20pineapple-20rosemary-20crush.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526014511-a-20glass-20of-20pineapple-20rosemary-20crush.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526014511-a-20glass-20of-20pineapple-20rosemary-20crush.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Pineapple Rosemary Crush"," How To Pineapple Rosemary Crush","Pineapple Rosemary Crush Cocktail","Pineapple Rosemary Crush Recipe","Pineapple Rosemary Crush Cokctail Recipe"],"name":"Pineapple Rosemary Crush","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 cups Fresh pineapple chunks or fruit of choice","8 Small sprigs of fresh rosemary","1 bottle of Sparkling wine, chilled","2 cans Ginger ale chilled, 12-oz.","Ice cubes"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"In the bottom of a cocktail glass, muddle two pineapple chunks and a small sprig of rosemary.","text":"In the bottom of a cocktail glass, muddle two pineapple chunks and a small sprig of rosemary.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/pineapple-rosemary-crush-recipe#step-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Fill the glass with ice.","text":"Fill the glass with ice.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/pineapple-rosemary-crush-recipe#step-2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Top off with sparkling wine and ginger ale.","text":"Top off with sparkling wine and ginger ale.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/pineapple-rosemary-crush-recipe#step-3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Garnish with pineapple wedge and rosemary.","text":"Garnish with pineapple wedge and rosemary.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/pineapple-rosemary-crush-recipe#step-4"}],"recipeYield":"","totalTime":"PT5M"}
