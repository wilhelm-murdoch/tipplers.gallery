It is made with tequila,\u0026amp;nbsp;absinthe, agave nectar, and bitters.The absinthe gives this cocktail an interesting licorice flavor, while the lemon juice adds tartness to it. Agave nectar balances out all of these flavors and makes for a smooth drink that you can enjoy any time!This recipe works best with high-quality tequila such as Fortaleza’s because they\u0026#39;re made from 100% blue agaves grown in Mexico.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429015648-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429015648-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429015648-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Tequila Sazerac","Tequila Sazerac Recipe","Tequila Sazerac Cocktail","Tequila Sazerac Cocktail Recipe","How To Tequila Sazerac"],"name":"Tequila Sazerac","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
