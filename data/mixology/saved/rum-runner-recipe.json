During prohibition, the trade and transport of alcohol were made illegal, making it difficult for people to get their hands on liquor.As a result, bootleggers would smuggle cases of kegs and bottles across state lines, dodging law enforcement to disseminate their wares to speakeasies across the country.This dangerous task was colloquially known as rum-running, which is also the namesake for this classic tropical cocktail. The Rum Runner cocktail is a simple mix of\u0026amp;nbsp;rum, liqueur, pineapple juice, lime juice, and grenadine.However, don\u0026#39;t let its simplicity fool you—this drink packs a\u0026amp;nbsp;flavorful punch. The bold taste of rum is tempered by the sweetness of the pineapple juice, while the lime juice adds a touch of tartness and gives the drink its beautiful golden color.Whether you\u0026#39;re looking for a delicious cocktail to enjoy by the pool or want to transport yourself back to the roaring twenties, the Rum Runner cocktail is sure to hit the spot.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523113655-a-20glass-20of-20rum-20runner.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523113655-a-20glass-20of-20rum-20runner.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523113655-a-20glass-20of-20rum-20runner.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Rum Runner","How To Rum Runner","Rum Runner Cocktail","Rum Runner Recipe","Rum Runner Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Rum Runner","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1 oz.
