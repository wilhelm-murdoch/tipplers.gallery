This simple two-ingredient cocktail is easy to whip up and requires only bourbon,\u0026amp;nbsp;brandy, or American\u0026amp;nbsp;rye whiskey over ice, topped with some\u0026amp;nbsp;ginger ale and a lemon peel garnish.Its unique flavor makes it the perfect drink to sip while you watch all the action of the race unfold. Whether you\u0026#39;re cheering on your favorite horse or just looking to enjoy a boozy cocktail on this festive day, the Horse\u0026#39;s Neck is a crowd favorite.Dating back to the late 19th century, the Horse’s Neck was originally a stimulating glass of non-alcoholic ginger ale—a\u0026amp;nbsp;\u0026amp;nbsp;jigger of bourbon, rye, or brandy was added somewhere down the line.This 2-ingredient cocktail is an easy-to-make crowd-pleaser, especially for those who like an exaggerated garnish (the Horse’s Neck gets its name from its long coiled lemon peel that snakes around the inside of the glass).","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506081045-a_glass_of_horse-e2-80-99s_neck-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506081045-a_glass_of_horse-e2-80-99s_neck-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506081045-a_glass_of_horse-e2-80-99s_neck-5b1-5d.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Horse’s Neck","How To Horse’s Neck","Horse’s Neck Cocktail","Horse’s Neck Recipe","Horse’s Neck Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Horse’s Neck","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
