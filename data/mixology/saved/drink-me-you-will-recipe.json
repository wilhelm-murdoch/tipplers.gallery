Sage simple syrup is a nod to Yoda’s wisdom, and a couple of those leaves make a nice, perky Yoda ear garnish.Apple brandy is often thought of as a fall spirit, and for a good reason—Calvados, the apple brandy used in this cocktail, is produced in Normandy, France, where the climate is cool and damp, ideal for growing apples.This cocktail amplifies the\u0026amp;nbsp;apple notes of the Calvados with fresh-squeezed apple cider, making it a refreshing and flavorful drink.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429072745-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429072745-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429072745-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Drink Me, You Will","Drink Me, You Will Recipe","Drink Me, You Will Cocktail","Drink Me, You Will Cocktail Recipes","How To Drink Me, You Will"],"name":"Drink Me, You Will","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
