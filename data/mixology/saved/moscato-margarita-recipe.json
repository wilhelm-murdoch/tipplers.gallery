But why settle for the same old lime-and-tequila combo when you can take your cocktail to the next level with Moscato and fresh strawberries?Just add a handful of berries and a splash of\u0026amp;nbsp;sweet wine to your blender, and you\u0026#39;re good to go. The result is a delicious, fruit-forward drink that\u0026#39;s perfect for sipping by the pool.And if strawberries aren\u0026#39;t your thing, you can always substitute\u0026amp;nbsp;pineapple,\u0026amp;nbsp;mango, or\u0026amp;nbsp;raspberry.
