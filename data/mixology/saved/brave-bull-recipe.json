This tequila-based cocktail is a twist on the classic\u0026amp;nbsp;Black Russian, made with Kahlua and tequila instead of\u0026amp;nbsp;vodka.The two flavors work together perfectly, and the agave in the tequila adds an extra dimension of flavor. The Brave Bull is a great choice for happy hour or dessert, and it\u0026#39;s sure to please anyone who enjoys a good coffee liqueur.Veracruz, Mexico, is home to some of the best coffee in the world. It should come as no surprise that the best coffee liqueur on the market comes from this region.Kahlúa is essential for any well-stocked bar. It is perfect for making Black Russians, Brave Bulls, and Keoke coffees, but it\u0026#39;s also a great way to celebrate\u0026amp;nbsp;Cinco de Mayo without drinking tequila alone.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429023128-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429023128-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429023128-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Brave Bull","Brave Bull Recipe","Brave Bull Cocktail","Brave Bull Cocktail Recipe","How To Brave Bull"],"name":"Brave Bull","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1.5 oz.
