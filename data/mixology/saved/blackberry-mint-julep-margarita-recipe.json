This allows for slow melting and dilution over time, helping to mellow the drink as it goes.Additionally, the choice of\u0026amp;nbsp;tequila in this recipe is an important one. Rather than using a standard Blanco or silver tequila, which is typically used in\u0026amp;nbsp;Margaritas, using an aged variety more closely resembles the bourbon that is traditionally used in Mint Juleps.Furthermore, using honey syrup rather than simple syrup helps to bring the cocktail closer to tradition, as bourbon generally lends notes of honey itself.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506062806-a-20glass-20of-20blackberry-20mint-20julep-20margarita.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506062806-a-20glass-20of-20blackberry-20mint-20julep-20margarita.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506062806-a-20glass-20of-20blackberry-20mint-20julep-20margarita.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita","How to Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita","Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita Cocktail","Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita Recipe"],"name":"Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["5 Blackberries","6 Mint leaves","1 oz.
