For Chris Cheng of Westroot Tavern in San Diego, that inspiration came from an unlikely source: the repulsive, slug-like crime boss Jabba the Hutt from the Star Wars franchise.Despite his distaste for puns, Cheng couldn\u0026#39;t resist employing some wordplay for this cocktail, which he appropriately named the Java the Hutt.This unique drink features\u0026amp;nbsp;vodka, white crème de cacao liqueur, cold-brew coffee, half-half, and simple syrup, all blended together to create a smooth and creamy beverage that\u0026#39;s perfect for any\u0026amp;nbsp;coffee lover.While it may not be the most appetizing drink to look at, it\u0026#39;s sure to tantalize your taste.
