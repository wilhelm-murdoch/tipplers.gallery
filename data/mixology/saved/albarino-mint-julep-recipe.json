Because this drink is made with Albariño, a type of\u0026amp;nbsp;white wine, it\u0026#39;s much less alcoholic than drinks made with stronger spirits like bourbon or rye-based whiskey.The peach-flavored liqueur helps balance out the flavor and adds a sweet note, making this drink ideal for sipping on a quiet porch or in the backyard garden on a warm spring or summer evening. This particular recipe calls for a large bunch of fresh mint to add aromatic flavor without muddling the mint leaves directly in the drink.Because this recipe does not require any\u0026amp;nbsp;muddling, you can easily pack a mountain of crushed ice and loads of fresh mint into any metal Julep cup or double rocks glass, depending on what you have on hand.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506072220-a-20glass-20of-20albari-c3-b1o-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506072220-a-20glass-20of-20albari-c3-b1o-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506072220-a-20glass-20of-20albari-c3-b1o-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Albariño Mint Julep","How To Albariño Mint Julep","Albariño Mint Julep Cocktail","Albariño Mint Julep Recipe","Albariño Mint Julep Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Albariño Mint Julep","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["3 oz.
