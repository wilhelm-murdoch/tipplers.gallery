This bar has been around for a while and its popularity is due in part to its signature cocktail, the El Guapo cocktail.El Guapo is a vividly rosy cocktail made with a puree of passion fruit, blood orange, and pomegranate. It has an unconventional\u0026amp;nbsp;garnish that’s new and unique.Thanks to original bar manager Michael Rowe, who put El Guapo on the menu back in 2011, guests have been flocking to the Box Social ever since.El Guapo, which translates into \u0026quot;The Handsome,\u0026quot; is a delicious and cool twist on the classic\u0026amp;nbsp;Margarita. Blanco\u0026amp;nbsp;tequila is the perfect base for this fruity drink, and the simple syrup and lime juice help balance out the sweetness of the fruit puree.The Box Social uses the Libélula brand of tequila, which is known for its smooth and mellow flavor. The inclusion of fruit puree makes this drink extra special, and it\u0026#39;s sure to be a hit with anyone who tries it.Whether you\u0026#39;re in the mood for a traditional Margarita or something a little different, El Guapo is a perfect choice.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523144554-a-20glass-20of-20el-20guapo.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523144554-a-20glass-20of-20el-20guapo.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220523144554-a-20glass-20of-20el-20guapo.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["El Guapo","How To El Guapo","El Guapo Cocktail","El Guapo Recipe","El Guapo Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"El Guapo","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
