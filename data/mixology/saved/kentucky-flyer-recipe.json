However, another drink has become synonymous with the Kentucky Derby—the Kentucky Flyer. The Kentucky Flyer was created by bartender Sierra Zimei in 2011 when she was working at the Four Seasons in San Francisco.It’s a variation on the classic\u0026amp;nbsp;Aviation cocktail, which dates back to the early 20th century and combines gin, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette, and fresh lemon juice.The Kentucky Flyer is a delicious and easy-to-make cocktail perfect for any occasion. The key ingredients are\u0026amp;nbsp;rye whiskey, lemon juice, maraschino liqueur, and cherry brandy.The rye whiskey gives the cocktail its strong and tart flavor, while the lemon juice provides a sourness reminiscent of\u0026amp;nbsp;Whiskey Sour. The maraschino liqueur adds a bittersweetness that compliments the cherry brandy.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506124425-glasses-20of-20kentucky-20flyer.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506124425-glasses-20of-20kentucky-20flyer.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506124425-glasses-20of-20kentucky-20flyer.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Kentucky Flyer ","How To Kentucky Flyer ","Kentucky Flyer Cocktail","Kentucky Flyer Recipe","Kentucky Flyer Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Kentucky Flyer ","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
