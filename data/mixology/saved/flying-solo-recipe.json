So it\u0026#39;s only fitting that there\u0026#39;s a cocktail named after him—and it\u0026#39;s just as confident and delicious as the character himself.The Flying Solo cocktail was created by Louis Hirsch during his time as GM of the now-closed Morels Steakhouse \u0026amp;amp; Bistro at The Palazzo in Las Vegas. He concocted this nod to Han Solo because only a person of his confidence could find a positive use for that pink-headed stepchild of the\u0026amp;nbsp;wine world, white zinfandel.This tasty concoction combines white zinfandel, Blanco\u0026amp;nbsp;tequila, fresh lemon juice, and agave nectar. The result is a reviving, tart drink with hints of red fruit flavor.So whether you\u0026#39;re spending a\u0026amp;nbsp;summer day outdoors or huddled indoors watching your favorite sci-fi saga, the Flying Solo is the perfect drink to enjoy.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429083505-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429083505-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429083505-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Flying Solo","Flying Solo Recipe","Flying Solo Cocktail","Flying Solo Cocktail Recipe","How To Flying Solo"],"name":"Flying Solo","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
