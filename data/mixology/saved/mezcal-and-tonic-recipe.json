Once largely unknown outside of Mexico, mezcal has become a staple on trendy cocktail menus across the globe.And for a good reason—mezcal is delicious, versatile, and complex. It is often compared to\u0026amp;nbsp;tequila, but the two drinks are actually quite different. Tequila is always made from blue agave, while mezcal can be made from any type of agave.Mezcal also has a smoky flavor, thanks to the wood-fired ovens used to roast the agave hearts. This smokiness makes mezcal a perfect choice for summer sipping.A Mezcal And Tonic is thirst-quenching and perfectly balanced—the acidity of the tonic cuts through the richness of the mezcal, while the herbs and spices in the tonic play well with the smoky flavor of the mezcal.So if you want to enjoy a delicious and unique summer cocktail without the added sugar, try the Mezcal and Tonic cocktail.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526030338-a-20glass-20of-20mezcal-20and-20tonic.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526030338-a-20glass-20of-20mezcal-20and-20tonic.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220526030338-a-20glass-20of-20mezcal-20and-20tonic.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Mezcal And Tonic","How To Mezcal And Tonic","Mezcal And Tonic Cocktail","Mezcal And Tonic Recipe","Mezcal And Tonicn Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Mezcal And Tonic","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
