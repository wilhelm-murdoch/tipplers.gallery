It\u0026#39;s a classic flip, a cocktail style distinguished by adding a whole egg and sometimes heavy cream. Flips are rich and creamy cold-weather drinks. It can also be used as an excellent nightcap, the final drink of the evening intended to send drinkers off to sleep.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20221227041933-2.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20221227041933-2.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20221227041933-2.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Rum Flip","Rum Flip Recipe","Rum Flip Cocktail","Rum Flip Cocktail Recipe","How To Make Rum Flip"],"name":"Rum Flip","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1 ½\u0026nbsp; oz.
