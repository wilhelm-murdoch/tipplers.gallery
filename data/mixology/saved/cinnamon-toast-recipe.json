The Cinnamon Toast is an awesome drink because of its notable spicier character than most other cocktails.The Fireball gives the drink a kick and sweetness from the cinnamon, while the Chila Orchata is\u0026amp;nbsp;rum-forward, adding more spiciness. Despite being both sweet, the combination of the two results in a smooth and almost comforting drink. This is also great as a shot for quicker preparation and enjoyment.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220426062131-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220426062131-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220426062131-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Cinnamon Toast","Cinnamon Toast Recipe","Cinnamon Toast Cocktail","Cinnamon Toast Cocktail Recipe","How To Cinnamon Toast"],"name":"Cinnamon Toast","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1 oz.
