It tells you, “We’re not kidding around here! This drink has\u0026amp;nbsp;gin mixed with green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice.We based ours on this classic but changed up some ingredients too: our version uses American Single Malt liquor (instead of Scotch) because it’s “smooth yet strong.”This beverage mixes with Tattersall Amaro from Minneapolis, and yellow Chartreuse. It’s also juiced with a splash of Meyer lemons, which are more savory than regular lemons and blends well with the single malt whiskey. This drink will take your taste buds on a wild ride!","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220216123212-a-20glass-20of-20s.T?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220216123212-a-20glass-20of-20s.T?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220216123212-a-20glass-20of-20s.T?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["S.T.F.U","S.T.F.U Recipe","S.T.F.U Cocktail","How To S.T.F.U","S.T.F.U Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"S.T.F.U","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["¾ oz.
