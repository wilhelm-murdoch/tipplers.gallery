The only difference is that this recipe uses equal parts of scotch and sweet vermouth, whereas Rob Roy uses a two-to-one proportion.This recipe also uses half an ounce of Benedictine instead of dashes of bitters for the Rob Roy. However, the Bobby Burns has a unique taste because it is made with blended scotch whisky.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211127135217-a-20glass-20of-20bobby-20burns.png?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211127135217-a-20glass-20of-20bobby-20burns.png?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211127135217-a-20glass-20of-20bobby-20burns.png?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Bobby Burns","Bobby Burns Recipe","Bobby Burns Cocktail","Bobby Burns Cocktail Recipe","How To Bobby Burns"],"name":"Bobby Burns","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1 oz.\u0026nbsp;Blended scotch whisky","1 oz.\u0026nbsp;Sweet vermouth","Â½ oz.\u0026nbsp;Benedictine","Lemon peel, for garnish"],"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Combine the\u0026nbsp;scotch,\u0026nbsp;vermouth, and benedictine into a mixing glass.","text":"Combine the\u0026nbsp;scotch,\u0026nbsp;vermouth, and benedictine into a mixing glass.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/bobby-burns-recipe#step-1"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Add some ice and stir until fully combined and chilled.","text":"Add some ice and stir until fully combined and chilled.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/bobby-burns-recipe#step-2"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Strain the contents into a cocktail glass.","text":"Strain the contents into a cocktail glass.","url":"https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/bobby-burns-recipe#step-3"},{"@type":"HowToStep","name":"Garnish it with a lemon peel.
