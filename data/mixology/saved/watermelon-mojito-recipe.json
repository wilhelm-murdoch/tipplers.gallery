The same can be said for the\u0026amp;nbsp;classic Mojito.An energizing, rum-spiked cocktail that is perfect for sipping on a hot day. So, when you combine the two, you get a drink that is sure to please. The\u0026amp;nbsp;watermelon provides a unique sweetness, while the mint gives the drink a cooling edge.The\u0026amp;nbsp;rum adds a bit of warmth and depth of flavor, making this cocktail the perfect refresher for a summer day.The Watermelon Mojito is a delicious riff on the\u0026amp;nbsp;classic drink. It features all of the traditional Mojito ingredients but substitutes agave nectar for simple syrup and omits the\u0026amp;nbsp;soda water completely. This small change makes a big difference and results in a truly unique and delicious drink.So don\u0026#39;t be afraid to experiment with your Mojitos—you might just end up with a new favorite!","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524015534-glasses-20of-20watermelon-20mojito.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524015534-glasses-20of-20watermelon-20mojito.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220524015534-glasses-20of-20watermelon-20mojito.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Watermelon Mojito","How To Watermelon Mojito","Watermelon Mojito Cocktail","Watermelon Mojito Recipe","Watermelon Mojito Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Watermelon Mojito","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["4 oz.
