This drink takes its name from the cantarito, or clay jarrito, which are commonly used to serve this and other popular drinks throughout Latin America.One variation of this cocktail hails from the town of Amatitán in Jalisco, Mexico, where it is known as the Cantarito de Amatitán. This unique version of the Cantarito adds agave nectar along with fresh citrus flavors and has become an essential part of celebratory occasions like\u0026amp;nbsp;Cinco de Mayo.For the best tasting version, any type of high-quality tequila will do, but a good Blanco Tequila might just make each sip better than it already is. Herradura Silver Blanco is a 45-day-aged medium-bodied tequila that gives a smooth, rich palate.It has pleasant citrus, herbs, and wood notes, which make it a great complement to\u0026amp;nbsp;simple cocktails.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429034256-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429034256-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429034256-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Cantarito","Cantarito Recipe","Cantarito Cocktail","Cantarito Cocktail Recipe","How To Cantarito"],"name":"Cantarito","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
