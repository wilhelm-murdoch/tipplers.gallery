This three-part recipe is absolutely perfect for experimentation, with plenty of room to play around and create unique variations. One popular version is the Jockey Club cocktail, which uses bourbon whiskey as its base along with sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur. There are also countless other variations, each with its own unique take on the traditional Manhattans formula.Between\u0026amp;nbsp;rye and bourbon, the former is usually considered the spicier of the two spirits, but when it comes to creating a perfect Jockey Club, bourbon is often the preferred choice. With its rich, smooth flavor and delightful notes of honey and oak, bourbon pairs perfectly with sweet vermouth, which provides an herbal, botanical backbone to the cocktail. When these ingredients are stirred together and poured into a chilled glass, the resulting drink is a well-balanced cocktail!","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506065916-a-20glass-20of-20jockey-20club.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506065916-a-20glass-20of-20jockey-20club.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506065916-a-20glass-20of-20jockey-20club.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Jockey Club","How To Jockey Club","Jockey Club Cocktail","Jockey Club Recipe","Jockey Club Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Jockey Club","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["1½ oz.
