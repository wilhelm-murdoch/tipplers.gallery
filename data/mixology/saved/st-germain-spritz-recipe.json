If you\u0026#39;re looking for a festive and refreshing drink to serve at your Easter gathering, we highly recommend this St. Germain Spritz.Made with dry\u0026amp;nbsp;sparkling wine, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, and a splash of\u0026amp;nbsp;club soda, it\u0026#39;s the perfect balance of sweet and sour. And best of all, it\u0026#39;s low in alcohol, so you can enjoy more than one without feeling too guilty.We also have a\u0026amp;nbsp;pomegranate version of this drink. The pomegranate flavor will make your mouth water with desire. The sweet taste is offset by hints of spice, making it an enjoyable choice for any palate!","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220412055656-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220412055656-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220412055656-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["St. Germain Spritz","St. Germain Spritz Recipe","St. Germain Spritz Cocktail","St. Germain Spritz Cocktail Recipe","How To St. Germain Spritz"],"name":"St. Germain Spritz","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
