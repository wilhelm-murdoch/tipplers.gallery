Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice provides a refreshing change of pace from traditional orange juice, while a homemade basil simple syrup adds sweetness and a bright, almost floral herbaceous quality. Just add\u0026amp;nbsp;prosecco and get sipping!To make the most of your mimosa experience, be sure to use high quality ingredients. For the grapefruit juice, opt for freshly squeezed rather than from concentrate for the best flavor. And for the prosecco, choose a bottle that you would enjoy drinking on its own. These small touches will elevate your mimosa game and have your guests coming back for more.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220507075625-glasses-20of-20grapefruit-20basil-20mimosa-20.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220507075625-glasses-20of-20grapefruit-20basil-20mimosa-20.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220507075625-glasses-20of-20grapefruit-20basil-20mimosa-20.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Grapefruit Basil Mimosa Recipe","Grapefruit Basil Mimosa Cocktail","Grapefruit Basil Mimosa Cocktail Recipe","How To Grapefruit Basil Mimosa","Grapefruit Basil Mimosa"],"name":"Grapefruit Basil Mimosa","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":""},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 tbsp.
