With a base of crisp mint and smooth\u0026amp;nbsp;bourbon, this cocktail is perfectly complemented by rich white crème de cacao and topped off with a Thin Mint cookie for an added burst of chocolatey sweetness.This drink is similar to\u0026amp;nbsp;traditional juleps in its construction, with crushed ice packed generously into the silver mug until the vessel is frosted on the outside. The pièce de résistance in this cocktail is the  Thin Mint cookie—adding a sweet and crunchy feeling that makes a tasty snack in between sips.While this recipe might stray from the classic formula of a julep, it still remains true to the spirit of this iconic cocktail.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506110841-glasses-20of-20thin-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506110841-glasses-20of-20thin-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220506110841-glasses-20of-20thin-20mint-20julep.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Thin Mint Julep","How To Thin Mint Julep","Thin Mint Julep Cocktail","Thin Mint Julep Recipe"],"name":"Thin Mint Julep","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"Brown Derby Cocktail"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["8 to 10 Fresh mint leaves","¼ oz.
