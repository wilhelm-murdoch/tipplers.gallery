It is then served on the rocks with a lime wedge with a salted rim.There is no clear history of this cocktail, but there are rumors that it was named after an 1860s popular folk song, La Paloma or The Dove. Whatever its history was, it is believed that Paloma originated from Mexico.Combining Paloma and Chambord, a raspberry liqueur creates the delicious Chambord Paloma cocktail drink. With a sweet and fruity flavor, this cocktail tastes divine! You can concoct these, especially when you have guests over.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211006071415-two-glasses-of-chambord-paloma-cocktail.png?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211006071415-two-glasses-of-chambord-paloma-cocktail.png?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20211006071415-two-glasses-of-chambord-paloma-cocktail.png?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Chambord Paloma Cocktail","Chambord Paloma","Chambord Paloma Recipe","How To Chambord Paloma ","Chambord Paloma Cocktail Recipe"],"name":"Chambord Paloma","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"150","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Cocktail Recipe\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["Ice","2 oz.
