Don\u0026#39;t confuse this boozy mix with Disney\u0026#39;s Galaxy\u0026#39; Edge blue milkshakes, which are served in a galaxy far away (or not).This Galactic\u0026amp;nbsp;Piña Colada twist from mixologist Karen Grill of Sassafras Saloon in Los Angeles is a star-studded cocktail. The concoction packs a creamy, citrus-flavored punch with a mix of gin, coconut cream,\u0026amp;nbsp;blue curaçao, vanilla syrup, orgeat syrup, pineapple juice, and lime juice.The aroma of this blue drink is both energizing and flavorful—you’ll want another sip.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429104407-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429104407-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429104407-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Blue Milk Of Tatooine","Blue Milk Of Tatooine Recipe","Blue Milk Of Tatooine Cocktail","Blue Milk Of Tatooine Cocktail Recipe","How To Blue Milk Of Tatooine"],"name":"Blue Milk Of Tatooine","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["2 oz.
