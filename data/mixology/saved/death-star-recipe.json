Attart creates a small \u0026quot;ice death star\u0026quot; to float in the drink, adding a touch of whimsy to an otherwise dark cocktail.Of course, if you don\u0026#39;t have a Star Wars ice mold in your freezer, regular ice cubes will do just fine. Either way, this is one Darth Vader tribute you won\u0026#39;t want to miss.The\u0026amp;nbsp;Long Island Iced Tea is a classic cocktail that has been around for decades. And, like all classics, it has undergone some variations and twists over the years. One of the most popular variations is the Death Star, which swaps out two of the liquors for different ones and also includes Coca-Cola.
