Originally from Mexico, this cocktail has become popular worldwide. It\u0026#39;s named after the Spanish word \u0026quot;dove,\u0026quot; whose light pink color is reminiscent of the bird\u0026#39;s plumage.There are many different recipes for Palomas, but they all typically include\u0026amp;nbsp;tequila, grapefruit juice, lime juice, and\u0026amp;nbsp;sparkling soda.While a typical Paloma calls for any type of tequila, a Mexican variety gives off the best result. Cazadores Blanco is the best choice for a Paloma cocktail. The fruitiness of the tequila pairs well with the citrus flavors in the drink, and the crispness of the tequila helps to balance out the sweetness of the grapefruit juice.","image":["https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429020820-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429020820-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=4:3\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium","https://images.getrecipekit.com/20220429020820-recipe-20card-20image.jpg?aspect_ratio=1:1\u0026quality=90\u0026auto_optimize=medium"],"keywords":["Paloma Tequila","Paloma Tequila Recipe","Paloma Tequila Cocktail","Paloma Tequila Cocktail Recipe","How To Paloma Tequila"],"name":"Paloma Tequila","nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","servingSize":"1"},"prepTime":"PT5M","recipeCategory":"","recipeCuisine":"","recipeIngredient":["Lime wedge for rimming (optional)","Coarse salt for rimming (optional)","2 oz.
