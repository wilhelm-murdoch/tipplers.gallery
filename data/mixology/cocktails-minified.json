It made its flowery foray into American culture between the 1930s and 1950s, thanks to tropical-minded entrepreneurs like Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt (a.k.a. Donn Beach) and Victor Jules Bergeron (a.k.a. Trader Vic). According to Beach, the Mai Tai was born in 1934 at his eponymous Hollywood spot, Don the Beachcomber.Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, it fell out of favor as bartenders began to experiment with fruity variations that included juices and artificial sweeteners. Thankfully, the Mai Tai has experienced a renaissance in recent years, with bartenders rediscovering the simple beauty of Beach's original recipe.While there are countless variations on the Mai Tai, the Latitude 29 Mai Tai comes from Tiki historian Jeff “Beachbum” Berry. Berry’s version is almost the same with that of the original. However, his take on this drink, calls for specific rums to be used. While both Coruba dark Jamaican rum and Rhum Clément V.S.O.P. are popular brands, it is possible to be in a market where you can’t find them. In this case, the best move is to find a close approximation of each, like another dark Jamaican rum to fill in for the Coruba.","ingredients":[{"name":"1 Oz.

Once largely unknown outside of Mexico, mezcal has become a staple on trendy cocktail menus across the globe.And for a good reason—mezcal is delicious, versatile, and complex. It is often compared to tequila, but the two drinks are actually quite different. Tequila is always made from blue agave, while mezcal can be made from any type of agave.Mezcal also has a smoky flavor, thanks to the wood-fired ovens used to roast the agave hearts. This smokiness makes mezcal a perfect choice for summer sipping.A Mezcal And Tonic is thirst-quenching and perfectly balanced—the acidity of the tonic cuts through the richness of the mezcal, while the herbs and spices in the tonic play well with the smoky flavor of the mezcal.So if you want to enjoy a delicious and unique summer cocktail without the added sugar, try the Mezcal and Tonic cocktail.","ingredients":[{"name":"2 Oz.
